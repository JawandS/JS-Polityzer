  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I hope you have been enjoying summer festivities and staying cool during the late summer heat waves. Fall is approaching and preparation for the season is beginning. Below is an update on news of interest. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>2023-2024 School Year</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">August 21 marks the first day of school for Richmond Public Schools. A back-to-school guide can be found at <a href="https://www.rvaschools.net/students-families/back-to-school" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this website </span></a>from RPS, which includes the 2023-2024 school year paperwork packet as well as helpful links to family resources, supplies checklist, bus routes, meal information and more. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Parents of rising Kindergarten, 7th, or 12th grade students should consult <a href="https://www.rvaschools.net/about/health-safety-20/immunizations" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this website</span></a> from RPS about required vaccinations. Additionally, Superintendent Kamras shared via his <a href="https://www.rvaschools.net/news/rps-direct-newletter" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">“RPS Direct” newsletter</span></a> several resources for vaccinations and physicals which are relayed below.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Richmond &amp; Henrico Health Districts</strong> will host several free immunization and physical events until August 17. Visit <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/richmond-city/childhood-immunization/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this website</span></a> to find upcoming dates.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Daily Planet Health Services</strong> offers school immunizations &amp; physicals by appointment at the Southside Health Center (180 East Belt Boulevard). Call 804-783-2505. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Bon Secours Care-a-Van</strong> offers same day pediatric appointments (including immunization &amp; physicals) on Tuesdays &amp; Wednesdays throughout August. Call 804-545-192 between 7-8:30 AM to schedule an appointment. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>CrossOver Healthcare Ministry</strong> will host an event at their Henrico clinic (8600 Quioccasin Road), August 17, 5:30-7:15 PM. Call 804-655-2794 to schedule an appointment. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I wish all our students a happy, healthy and productive school year!</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission Recent Findings</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission (JLARC) on which I serve, recently met to present their findings from a review of Virginia’s K-12 education funding and funding formula. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The full report can be found <a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf?emci=4912510b-5022-ee11-a9bb-00224832eb73&amp;emdi=37184f6e-6422-ee11-a9bb-00224832eb73&amp;ceid=1261019" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">here</span></a> and a recording of the presentation can be found <a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/calendar.asp" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">at this link</span></a>. The report confirms what is no secret: Virginia underfunds its public education system. What is of importance from this report is the degree to which Virginia underfunds its education system and the discrepancy between the funding formula and the true cost. JLARC’s report found that per-student, school districts in Virginia receive 14% less than the 50-state average, and regionally receive less than Maryland, West Virginia, and Kentucky. This comes to about $1,900 fewer dollars being spent on each student than the national average.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">JLARC found that Virginia’s Standards of Quality funding formula routinely projects funding needs that are 38% lower than what districts actually end up spending. For example, in 2021, the formula calculated a cost of $10.7 billion. Districts that year spent $17.3 billion. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read more about the JLARC report <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/10/study-finds-virginia-underfunds-k-12-schools-recommends-spending-billions-more/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">in this article</span></a> from The Virginia Mercury.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Richmond Charter Review Commission’s Recommendations</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Richmond Charter Review Commission has concluded its review and drafted their proposed changes. The proposed changes include changes to the structure of Richmond’s governance, with recommendations to change the nine seat city council to a six seat, as well as the addition of a city manager, as well as other changes. Any changes to Richmond’s charter would require State and local approval. Town halls on the subject are expected to be held in the near future. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read more about the Charter Review Commission’s work in <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/city-charter-richmond-changes/article_57931136-35fd-11ee-8e0a-4747c259f187.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this article</span></a> from The Richmond Times-Dispatch and <a href="https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2023/aug/10/citys-charter-review-commission-releases-report/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this article</span></a> from Richmond Free Press. You can read the press release announcing the conclusion <a href="https://richmondvacitycouncil.blogspot.com/2023/08/richmond-city-charter-review-commission.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">at this link</span></a> and you can find the 168-page document of the proposed changes <a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/Richmond%20City%20Charter%20Review%20Commission%202023%20Final%20Report%208.2.2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">here.</span></a></p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Early Voting Locations</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Richmond Electoral Board has reversed its previous decision to close two of the three early voting locations after public outcry. The Board did decide to cancel early voting on Sundays. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Beginning September 22, Richmonders can vote early at the Richmond Registrar’s office (2134 West Laburnum Avenue), Richmond City Hall (900 East Broad Street), and Hickory Hill Community Center (3000 East Belt Boulevard). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ensuring equal access to the ballot is vital for our democracy and I am happy to see the Board reverse their decision to limit access.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Update</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The State Air Pollution Control Board voted in June for Virginia to withdraw its participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which is an 11 state market that requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for each ton of carbon dioxide they produce. The revenues, which have totaled over half a billion since Virginia began participation in 2021, are used to fund energy efficiency and flood resiliency efforts. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In response to the Air Pollution Control Board’s vote, a lawsuit is expected to be filed in Fairfax by the Southern Environmental Law Center, on behalf of environmental groups such as Appalachian Voices, Association of Energy Conservation Professionals, Faith Alliance for Climate Solutions, and Virginia Interfaith Power and Light. The basis of the lawsuit is that Virginia’s participation in RGGI is under the General Assembly’s authority and the Governor’s administration does not have the authority to unilaterally decide to withdraw.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read more about the lawsuit <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/31/virginia-enviro-groups-file-notice-they-will-challenge-youngkins-rggi-withdrawal/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">in this article</span></a> from The Virginia Mercury.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>RetirePath Program Launch</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">RetirePath Virginia is a new program, administered by Virginia529, which creates a workplace savings retirement account for employees who are not offered one at their current job. Employers who do not currently offer an employer-sponsored retirement savings option can enroll in RetirePath and give employees a retirement savings account while not bearing any fiduciary responsibility or additional fees. This provides a tremendous boon to the 1 million private-sector employees who are on their own when it comes to retirement planning. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Employers can learn more, register, and certify existing plans <a href="https://www.retirepathva.com/employers" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">at this link</span></a>. If you are self-employed or work for an employer who is not registered with RetirePath, you can still enroll by <a href="https://www.retirepathva.com/savers" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">using this link</span></a>. Finally, if you would like RetirePath to host a webinar and present to your organization, fill out <a href="https://www.retirepathva.com/resources/webinars" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this form</span></a>.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Richmond Connects Survey</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Richmond Connects is collecting feedback on hundreds of projects that make up the “Near-Term Action Plan,” which covers the next 10 years in the City. There are 17 surveys that correspond to different neighborhoods of the City. Richmond residents are encouraged to complete surveys for neighborhoods in which they live, work, commute through, or spend a significant amount of time. Surveys, as well as a map of the listed projects, can be found <a href="https://rvaconnects.com/survey4/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">at this link</span></a>.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>City of Richmond Tax Relief for Elderly and Persons with Disabilities</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The City of Richmond’s Department of Finance Tax Relief Team is hosting a community engagement event, August 19, 10 AM - 2 PM at Huguenot Community Center (7945 Forest Hill Avenue, Building 26). The event will provide information about the tax relief program and give citizens an opportunity to get personalized assistance with their applications. If you are interested in the program, but unable to attend this event, you can email TaxRelief@rva.gov for information and assistance. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Update on Virginia Craft Beer Distribution</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As mentioned in the last newsletter, the passage of&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2258="><span style="text-decoration:underline">HB2258</span></a>&nbsp;established the Virginia Beer Distribution Company (VBDC), a state agency nested in the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Through the VBDC, craft breweries will be able to self-distribute up to 500 barrels&nbsp;of their product directly to retailers if they do not already have a distributor. This bill still upholds Virginia's "three-tiered" system which protects consumers and ensures a robust marketplace because the Commonwealth will act as the distributor through the VBDC and allows craft breweries whose volume did not warrant&nbsp;going through traditional&nbsp;distribution a way to market.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a note, the VBDC would require $760,000 in initial&nbsp;funds from the state budget to form, before self-funding through fees. Due to ongoing budget negotiations, this initial funding is not yet appropriated.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virginia Museum of History &amp; Culture Honored</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Virginia Museum of History &amp; Culture received the “Award of Excellence,” the highest honor from the American Association of State and Local History (AASLH). The Museum’s recent renovation and reimagination, completed in 2022, was the deciding factor in the Museum’s nomination and award.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Museum has several exhibits and events upcoming, like “Virginia Distilled,” a celebration of Virginia craft spirits, September 9, 6 PM (event information <a href="https://secure.virginiahistory.org/2374/2375" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">here</span></a>). &nbsp;</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Librarian of Virginia to Retire</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sandra Treadway, the Librarian of Virginia, announced she will retire at the end of the calendar year. She has served the Library of Virginia for 45 years, serving as the State Librarian for the last 16 and as Deputy Librarian for 11 years prior to that. Dr. Treadway’s leadership saw the library greatly expand its digitization of archives and make them accessible in new and relevant ways for Virginians. Additionally, Dr. Treadway oversaw monumental historical commemorations during her tenure as State Librarian such as Jamestown 2007; the Virginia Sesquicentennial of the American Civil War Commission; The Virginia Bicentennial of the War of 1812 Commission; and American Evolution, 2019. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read more about Dr. Treadway’s career as well as the search process for the tenth state librarian at <a href="https://www.lva.virginia.gov/news/press/Media_Release_Librarian_of_Virginia_Dr_Sandra_G_Treadway_to_Retire.pdf?blm_aid=42434" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this link</span></a>. In addition she co-authored the two volume Virginia Women: Their Lives &amp; Times.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>House Page Program</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The House of Delegates Page program provides 13 and 14 year old students the opportunity to work in the General Assembly during the Legislative Session to become deeply familiar with the State’s legislative process. Applications are being accepted until October 16, 5 PM.

They recently completed a complete renovation and overhaul of a derelict factory building in Southside, which now houses the majority of their programs; which range from providing temporary shelter, to rigorous curriculums designed to help treat substance use disorders while building social emotional coping and workplace readiness skills. CARITAS also manage a furniture bank and administer a workforce development program.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I hope you have been staying cool amid the rising temperatures and staying safe during dramatic summer storms. Primary elections concluded last week and next week will bring the enactment of many new laws passed by the legislature earlier this year, as well as the celebration of National July 4 Holiday. Below is an update on those events and other news of interest. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Primary Election Results</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tuesday, June 20, marked primary elections across the State. Thank you to everyone who turned out to vote. Several incumbents will not be returning and many new faces are likely to be in the General Assembly next year. You can find complete election results for statewide primaries at <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20230620/close-races/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this page</span></a> from the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Richmond residents participated in a Senate and a House of Delegates Primary. The results are as follows:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">House of Delegates District 79:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Winner: Rae Cousins</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senate District 14:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Winner: Lamont Bagby (incumbent)</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Primary winners will appear on the General Election Ballot, which voters will consider on November 7. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Laws Taking Effect July 1</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Bills that are passed by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor take effect as law on July 1 each year, unless otherwise noted in the bill by a delayed enactment. The Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP) has created <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/new-laws-in-effect-2023/"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this website</span></a> to highlight notable new laws. Additionally, The Richmond Times-Dispatch has published <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/laws-taking-effect-saturday-to-bring-change-to-virginians-daily-lives/article_a7545368-145d-11ee-8a63-b3c8ea70444e.html#tracking-source=mp-homepage" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this article</span></a> focused on new laws. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This year, over 700 bills were signed into law. Many bring minor and technical changes to the law, and others are sure to impact the day-to-day life of many Virginians. I will highlight some of the larger pieces of signed legislation below as well as some lesser known laws that are coming. This is by no means a comprehensive review of new laws.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may find <a href="http://dls.virginia.gov/pubs/idc/idc23.pdf"><span style="text-decoration:underline">In Due Course</span></a>, a publication from the Department of Legislative Services to be a helpful review of the laws that will take effect July 1.

Legislators in odd numbered years, such as this year’s past session, have an opportunity to make amendments to the biennial budget. The General Assembly failed to agree on major amendments this year and instead passed a “skinny” stopgap budget which provided a limited number of necessary appropriations. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It was recently reported that there would be no budget negotiation before the close of the fiscal year, June 30. Any budget negotiation that could be passed would be the result of the Governor calling a special session later this Summer. If that is not called, then the Governor will have an additional $3.5 Billion in surplus to construct his first biennial budget since taking office.

This can be a helpful resource, especially for those in at-risk groups.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virginia Humanities Grant Opportunities</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Virginia Humanities has announced several new grant opportunities. Grants are offered to support projects that explore Virginia’s history, people, and cultural traditions. Funded project examples include print publications, festivals, community forums, exhibits, and much more. For more information on grants, including how to apply, visit <a href="https://virginiahumanities.org/grants/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Legislator%20Update&amp;utm_content=Legislator%20Update+CID_a961ab9ee4ac60c8a25003382d3079fb&amp;utm_source=Campaign%20Monitor&amp;utm_term=More" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this website</span></a>.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>James River Real Estate Deals</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two important real estate deals have recently been brokered that protect and promise enduring park land along the James River.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mayo Island is set to be purchased by the City of Richmond, with a conservation easement. The island would be reverted to a park, with its few buildings and parking lots cleared out. The Mayo Bridge is also set to be replaced in the coming years. You can read more about this development <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/richmond-takes-key-step-in-buying-mayo-island/article_e41f1694-da2d-11ed-8ed6-f759df32105c.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">here.</span></a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The other recent deal saw the Capital Region Land Conservancy (CRLC) receive the real estate interests of the Historic James Greenbelt Corporation (HJGC). The HJGC facilitated a gift of the first 31 acres of land which became the James River Park System 50 years ago. It had retained a third party right of enforcement to take lands back should the City fail to protect the lands and use them for their gifted purpose; such as building commercial space or failing to be a good steward. These interests are now transferred to the CRLC, who co-holds the conservation easement with the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Richmond Healthy Homes Program</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The City is offering a first come, first serve funding opportunity for home owners with qualifying income levels. Qualified individuals can apply to have aging water heaters replaced, deteriorating steps and porches repaired, bathroom and kitchen fixtures replaced, leaking roofs repaired or replaced, and much more. Projects that will cost under $14,999 will receive a grant that does not need to be repaid. Projects over $15,000 will be issued a forgivable loan that does not need to be repaid unless the homeowner sells or moves out of the home during the loan period. In such case, the loan will not accrue interest. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Those interested can reach out to Don Grivetti for more information at Don.Grivetti@rva.gov or 804-646-4078 or you can call 804-646-1766 for general information. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virginia Public Media Headquarters </strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Virginia Public Media (VPM) has recently announced their plan to move their headquarters from Chesterfield to Downtown Richmond.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spring’s temperate spirit is slowly ceding to Summer’s abundance of heat and daylight. I hope you find ways to stay cool and enjoy seasonal celebrations. Following is an update on some news of interest to our Commonwealth’s citizens.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Monroe Park Shooting</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yesterday afternoon, a tragic shooting occurred in Monroe Park, just after Huguenot High School completed their graduation ceremony in nearby Altria Theatre. Seven victims were shot, and two of them, a graduate and his father, did not survive. This senseless violence occurred on what was to be a joyous and momentous day for these students. Our children deserve much better than this. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Primary Election</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tuesday, June 20, is primary election day in Virginia. Richmond residents will vote in either a Senate or a House primary, possibly both. Early voting will continue Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM, as well as Saturday June 10 &amp; 17 at the Richmond Registrar’s Office (2134 West Laburnum Avenue). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can find who is on your ballot and learn more about your new district by entering your home address into the main page of the <a href="https://www.vpap.org/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Virginia Public Access Project</span></a> (VPAP). You can also visit the <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/citizen-portal/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Department of Elections’ website</span></a> to view your registration status and find your polling location. Lastly, to look at a map of your new district, visit <a href="https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this website</span></a> from the General Assembly and enter your home address. It will display your current representation and give an option to view the new maps. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Hurricane Season</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">June 1 marked the beginning of Atlantic Hurricane Season, which runs through November. It is important to ensure you are prepared for any potential storms. Monitoring local news stations will keep you updated for upcoming weather systems. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the event of a storm, make sure your house is properly stocked with emergency materials and your home is secured to the best of your ability. You can find guidance on emergency checklists, house preparations, and much more at <a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/threats/hurricanes/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this comprehensive website </span></a>from the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. In case of power outages or downed lines, you can report them to Dominion <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/report-outage-or-emergency" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">at this link</span></a>.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>US Debt Limit Bill</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">President Biden signed the US Fiscal Responsibility Act to suspend US debt and prevent a first ever US default, which experts believed would trigger economic recession. You can read more about this legislation <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">at this link</span></a>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Worth noting, the agreement included several concessions. One of which was a permitting provision for the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Our Congresswoman, Jennifer McClellan, led her House Democratic colleagues in submitting an amendment to remove this provision from the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Senator Kaine, with support from Senator Warner, submitted an identical amendment in the Senate. The amendments were unsuccessful. You can read more <a href="https://mcclellan.house.gov/media/press-releases/virginia-house-democrats-submit-amendment-strip-mountain-valley-pipeline" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">here.</span></a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, the legislation will bring new work requirements for some recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Able-bodied recipients without dependents and aged 49 to 54 will be required to work or attend training for 80 hours a month. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Richmond City Budget Adopted</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Richmond City Council adopted the City’s budget for fiscal year 2024. You can read more about the budget at <a href="https://www.rva.gov/index.php/richmond-city-council/richmond-budget" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this link</span></a>. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Medicaid Redetermination</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) and the Department of Social Services (DSS) have been working to redetermine medicaid recipients’ coverage, a process which was halted during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure Virginians had access to proper healthcare during the novel virus’ proliferation. DMAS &amp; DSS will redetermine coverages throughout 2023. If you are a medicaid recipient, the most important thing to do is ensure your contact information is up-to-date and correct. You can learn how to update your contact information, sign-up for newsletter updates, and learn more about the redetermination process at <a href="https://coverva.dmas.virginia.gov/members/update-your-information/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this link</span></a>.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Richmond Charter Review Commission</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Richmond Charter Review Commission has been tasked with reviewing the City Charter and making recommendations for its improvement. They have held several meetings to engage the public in this process. Additionally, the public is invited to fill out <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/chartercommission2023" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this survey</span></a> before June 21. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Cannabis Control Authority Town Hall</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CCA) is hosting town halls across the state.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spring and its joyous festivities and beautiful blossoms are in full swing. Many important religious holidays recently passed and I hope all those who observe had a wonderful holiday. In other news, last week saw the General Assembly return to Richmond for the Reconvene Session. The coming weeks bring warmer temperatures and many exciting events. Below is an update on Reconvene Session, as well as other state and local news.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reconvene Session</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last Wednesday, April 12, the General assembly met for the Reconvene Session (sometimes referred to as a veto session) to receive the Governor’s actions on bills. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There has not been a compromise on the state budget yet, but a few minor amendments to the “skinny,” stopgap budget were agreed to. The action of the four amendments does the following:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Updates the State budget’s front page to reflect increased general fund expenditures and tax conformity measures.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Provides funding ($9.2 million in 2023 and $6.1 million in 2024) for TANF Unemployed Parents Program. This reflects recent estimates for the program’s cost.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Adjusts disbursement of American Rescue Plan Act funds to support Medicaid eligibility redeterminations which are required by the end of the federal mandate on continuous eligibility coverage, which was in place for the COVID-19 pandemic. This amendment provides the Department of Medical Assistance Services with $38.1 million to assist with Medicaid eligibility redetermination as well as support for local departments of social services who will perform eligibility redeterminations and appeals. </p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Authorizes a $43.3 million treasury loan as a show of good faith for Jefferson Lab’s hopeful bid to create and administrate a state of the art data facility. Jefferson Lab is a finalist in a search by the U.S. Department of Energy for the project and the loan will only be awarded if Jefferson Lab is chosen for the project. </p></li></ol><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Besides the budget, over 70 other pieces of legislation received amendments from the Governor and were considered by the General Assembly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One set of amendments to a bill were meant to tighten enforcement on hemp-derived products. The Governor’s amendments added further restrictions on the amount of THC (the psychoactive compound in marijuana) allowed in hemp products as well as more regulations on the sellers of these products. You can read more about the approved amendments in <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/12/virginia-lawmakers-ok-final-edits-to-bill-meant-to-get-tough-on-unregulated-thc/">this article</a> from The Virginia Mercury.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Reconvene Session also saw more retirement speeches from legislators who will not be seeking re-election. Speeches heard included those from historic figures such as, Delegate Ken Plum, who is the second longest serving member of the House of Delegates and Delegate Eileen Filler-Corn, who was the first woman and Jewish speaker of the House of Delegates. Delegate Plum was the oldest member retiring from the House. The youngest retiree, Will Wampler, III, also gave a speech. You can find Delegate Plum’s speech <a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230412/-1/18115?startposition=20230412122033&amp;viewMode=2&amp;globalStreamId=4">here</a>, Delegate Filler-Corn’s speech <a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230412/-1/18115?startposition=20230412125826&amp;viewMode=2&amp;globalStreamId=4">at this link</a>, and Delegate Wampler’s<a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230412/-1/18115?startposition=20230412154552&amp;viewMode=2&amp;globalStreamId=4"> here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read more about the legislation considered at the Reconvene Session in <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/assembly-backs-youngkin-on-hemp-bills-asserts-power-on-others/article_36995222-d957-11ed-9b01-ebce6db41748.html">this link</a> from The Richmond Times-Dispatch.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Mifepristone Ban</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Earlier this month, a Texas Judge ruled against the FDA’s approval of Mifepristone, a medication which has been used for over two decades for early-stage abortions and is used in over half of all abortion care regimens in the U.S. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The 5th District Court overruled this decision, but also put in place medical restrictions that were deemed unnecessary by the FDA in 2016. Although access to the drug is still available, the issue is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has issued a temporary stay as of April 21.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Mifepristone decision undermines medical expertise and instead favors opinions of political appointees, a dangerous precedent. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Moreover, this decision comes in the wake of a seeming trend of overt politicization of judiciaries. Justice Clarence Thomas’s failure to report gifts of opulent trips from a conservative donor is a recent example.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Board of Education Adopts History Standards</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The tumultuous process of adopting history and social science standards to go in effect in the 2025-2026 school year has finally come to a close. The Board of Education adopted the history standards Thursday afternoon after months of debates. Now, the Board will work to approve curriculum frameworks and textbooks, a much more arduous process. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read about the process <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/20/after-months-of-debate-virginia-board-of-education-adopts-history-standards/" target="_blank">in this article</a> from The Virginia Mercury.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Monument Avenue 10k Race</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This Saturday, April 22, is the Monument Avenue 10k race. Several road closures will be in effect for the first portion of the day. View the maps below for road closure information as well <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/monument-avenue-10k-2023-street-closings-no-parking-zones/article_8a00070c-df70-11ed-b4f4-e39cd2f77cac.html" target="_blank">this link</a> for more in-depth information. Good luck to all those running on Saturday. </p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virginia Driver’s License Redesign</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Beginning Monday, April 24, the Department of Motor Vehicles will begin distributing redesigned licenses and ID Cards. The new cards feature Jefferson’s Rotunda at the Virginia State Capitol, as well as the state flower (the Dogwood) and the state insect (the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail Butterfly).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, these new cards have the latest in ID Security technology to prevent counterfeiting and enhance validation processes.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virginia Humanities Award Grants</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Virginia Humanities awarded 19 grants for programs and organizations across the state. Four were awarded to Richmond-area organizations: Gallery 5, VCU, University of Richmond, and Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. You can read more about the awarded grants <a href="https://virginiahumanities.org/2023/04/announcing-nineteen-grants/" target="_blank">here.</a></p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Earth Day</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Saturday, April 22, is Earth Day. This holiday marks the birth of the modern environmental movement and invokes reflection on how we as humans can be good stewards of the planet we call home. As such there are numerous events and opportunities to give back to our environment and ecosystem. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On Sunday, April 23, 10 AM - 12 PM, there will be a clean-up of Manchester at Hatch Local Food Hall. More information is available <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/manchester-clean-up-x-keep-virginia-cozy-tickets-620827009297" target="_blank">at this link.</a> The Carillon Civic Association will also be holding an invasive plant removal on Sunday, April 23, at 11 AM. They will begin near Rugby Road &amp; Carillon Court and move down Blanton Avenue. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, the James River Association is looking for volunteers to join the James River Watch. These volunteers help water testing efforts along the James to monitor bacteria levels and communicate water sanitation levels to the public. Interested volunteers can sign up for a virtual training session to be held on April 26, 5:30 - 6:30 PM at <a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEsc-mrqD8jGdMLV6LERggrdS4gKdcUg1C0#/registration" target="_blank">this link</a>.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spring has officially begun and Virginia’s beautiful bloom is nearing. I hope you find time to enjoy the coming temperate temperatures and fresh foliage. The General Assembly will meet for the reconvene session on April 12 to receive the Governor’s actions on legislation that passed the General Assembly. Below is an update on state and local news.&nbsp;</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Governor’s Actions</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The General Assembly communicated 819 bills to the Governor’s desk for review. The Governor has acted on 385 of these bills thus far. The Governor has until March 27 to act on the remaining 434 pieces of legislation.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">385 bills have been signed into law by the Governor, including my <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1765" target="_blank">HB1765</a>, which expands the definition of a fire company to include companies that provide rehabilitative services to firefighters at active scenes, as well as <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1744" target="_blank">HB1744</a> which establishes transferability of home studies for adoption and foster care services.&nbsp;</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Most of the signed bills are technical clean-ups to code and were uncontroversial in their passage. Larger pieces of legislation, like the&nbsp;“skinny budget” and utility rate reform have not been signed yet.&nbsp;</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read more about some of the new laws in <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-laws/article_9b1c706a-c7f2-11ed-9b88-4ff4ebb61d92.html" target="_blank">this article</a>, from the<em> Richmond Times-Dispatch.</em></p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you wish to review session proceedings and happenings, you can read the weekly session updates on <a href="https://www.betsycarr.org/blog" target="_blank">my blog</a>.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>History Standards</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Board of Education met Tuesday for its final public hearing on the Department of Education’s third revision of the history &amp; social study education standards.

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spring is on the horizon and I am looking forward to enjoying the beauty of a Virginian bloom and all the festivities that accompany it. On the legislative front, the General Assembly has concluded its work for now and adjourned sine die. Now, the legislature waits for the Governor to take action on the bills sent to his desk. We will reconvene on April 12 to take action on his amendments and vetoes. Below is a wrap-up on what the General Assembly has sent to the Governor for review, in addition to other state and local news.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>2023 Session Wrap-Up</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The 2023 Session saw over 1,800 House &amp; Senate bills and over 1,000 resolutions from the two bodies introduced between. Over 800 House &amp; Senate bills are being sent to the Governor’s desk. The Governor has 6 weeks to take action, listed below, on the bills.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sign the bill into law.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Send the bill back to the General Assembly with amendments. The House &amp; Senate then vote on adoption of these amendments.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Veto the bill which the House &amp; Senate can override if 2/3rds of each chamber votes to do so.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Take no action on the bill. The bill will become law without the Governor’s signature.</p></li></ol><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Below is a review of some topics that were considered by the General Assembly this Session, and what will and what will not be making it to the Governor’s desk. This is by no means a comprehensive recap. If you are interested in specific pieces of legislation or are curious about action on a certain topic, reach out to my office at 804-698-1069 or by email at <a href="mailto:Delegate.carr@betsycarr.org?subject=null&amp;body=null">Delegate.Carr@BetsyCarr.org</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>“Skinny Budget”</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The General Assembly’s most important piece of legislation each year is the budget bill. Even numbered years see the adoption of a fresh, biennial budget, while odd-numbered years, like 2023, see consideration of amendments and tweaks to the biennial budget. While Virginia technically has a budget spanning 2022-2024, the General Assembly was not able to agree to changes to this budget.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At a minimum, there were 4 items that needed to be passed this Session to meet financial commitments. The 4 items in the conference report that were passed serve as a stopgap budget. It is unknown if and when the General Assembly may reconvene to consider further budget amendments.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I mentioned in last week’s newsletter, the 4 items in the “skinny budget” are:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over $250 million in funding for public education that reflects the combined impacts of technical adjustments to average daily membership (ADM), sales tax forecasts, and program participation rates. It also provides $16 million to ensure no school receives less funding than was communicated by the Department of Education due to <a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=a4969e985a&amp;e=ff634425ab" target="_blank">their technical error.</a></p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over $900 million in funding to the “rainy day fund” to meet constitutionally required deposits.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$250 million to the Virginia Retirement System to continue addressing unfunded liability.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">An additional $100 million to the Capital Supplement Pool to address supply chain issues and inflation that have been driving up the cost of previously approved capital projects. With this deposit, the supplement pool will have $450 million within it.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Utility Rate Reform</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This year several bills were introduced to lower ratepayer bills and reform oversight of Dominion rate-setting. A pair of Dominion-backed House &amp; Senate bills (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Hb1770" target="_blank">HB1770</a> &amp; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Sb1265" target="_blank">SB1265</a>) were the most notable bills on this topic. I opposed these bills in their original forms on grounds that they were going to be a bad deal for ratepayers and would weaken the Virginia Clean Economy Act. However, these bills were heavily amended throughout Session and by sine die, were in a posture that had allowed groups like the Virginia Poverty Law Center &amp; the Sierra Club of Virginia to change their position from oppose to neutral.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As passed by the General Assembly, this legislation will do the following.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">First, it moves $350 million worth of rate adjustment clauses (the list of specific items on your electric bill) into Dominion’s base electricity rate, which will result in a small reduction in residential customers’ monthly bill.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Second, it will give the State Corporation Commission (SCC) full oversight to adjust electricity rates, on a biennial review schedule beginning July 1 of this year. This increases oversight and will allow regulators to review the costs people are paying to Dominion more frequently and ensure they are proper.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition to rate-setting oversight, the SCC will gain full discretion on the methodology that is used to determine Dominion Energy’s return on equity, or profit. The SCC will receive this authority in 2025 following a 2-year transition period in which Dominion’s profit margin will be set at 9.7%, an increase from their current rate of 9.35%.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The SCC will also be given additional tools, namely bond securitization, to determine how best to deal with the rising and volatile cost of natural gas and fossil fuels while protecting customers during the transition to renewable energy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read more about this legislation in <em>The Virginia Mercury </em><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/25/general-assembly-deal-sets-dominion-profits-for-two-years-while-overhauling-regulatory-system/" target="_blank">here</a><em>, </em>and in <em>The Richmond Times-Dispatch </em><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/general-assemblys-final-day-deal-promises-savings-on-dominion-bills/article_e6c7c426-b526-11ed-8d73-174e98bd193c.html" target="_blank">here</a><em>.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Solitary Confinement</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A bipartisan effort (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2487" target="_blank">HB2487</a>) to eliminate the practice of solitary confinement in Virginia State Prisons is heading to the Governor’s desk. You can read about this inspiring piece of bipartisan legislation from Leader Don Scott and Delegate Glenn Davis in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/04/virginia-solitary-confinement-general-assembly/" target="_blank">this article</a> from <em>The Washington Post</em> (note: link may be paywall restricted).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Automatic License Plate Readers</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A pair of bills (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1437" target="_blank">HB1437</a> &amp; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1165" target="_blank">SB1165</a>) were introduced to allow law enforcement to install and operate automatic license plate readers (ALPRs) in right of ways maintained by VDOT. Although these bills were poised for easy passage, concerns arose over data-protection concerns and fear that this bill would allow a network of ALPRs to collect millions of data points that could be manipulated by artificial intelligence. These bills were ultimately defeated.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Abortion</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Several bills were introduced this Session that aimed to restrict (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2278" target="_blank">HB2278</a>, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1488" target="_blank">HB1488</a>, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1483" target="_blank">SB1483</a>) or ban access (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1395" target="_blank">HB1395</a>) to abortions. These bills and other related ones were all defeated.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Cannabis</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This past Session has left the topic of a state-regulated, recreational cannabis market on hold. Although the 2021 Session allowed for limited, legal possession of cannabis by adults age 21 and older, further creation of a regulatory framework has been stymied by Republican control of the House and a disinterest in pursuing the topic.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While no legislation was passed to establish a regulatory framework for the sale of recreational cannabis, legislation was passed (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2294" target="_blank">HB2294</a> &amp; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB903" target="_blank">SB903</a>) to tighten enforcement on hemp-derived products that contain intoxicating amounts of THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis. Another piece of legislation (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB1233" target="_blank">SB1233</a>) will provide marijuana advertising restrictions. These bills are headed to the Governor for action. You can read more about this legislation in <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/24/virginia-lawmakers-pass-bill-to-get-tougher-on-hemp-that-gets-you-high/" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The lack of a budget compromise has put the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (VCCA) in a tough position. The Governor and the House’s budget proposals included a sharp reduction in the VCCA’s budget. The VCCA was created to be the state’s lead authority on enforcement and regulation of cannabis in Virginia, with additional responsibility of leading awareness and education campaigns. The VCCA is in a waiting period to see what, if any, additional budget action may bring to their agency funding. The Governor and House had proposed reducing this year’s funding from $8.2 million to $3 million and next year’s from $11.2 million to $3 million. Read more on this <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/02/virginias-new-cannabis-authority-faces-more-responsibilities-possible-budget-cuts/" target="_blank">in this article</a> from <em>The Virginia Mercury</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>School Choice</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A priority of Governor Youngkin’s was expanding “school choice,” which implies removing money from public school funding to allow more students to pursue private education. Several bills were introduced on this subject. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1508" target="_blank">HB1508</a> gained the most traction. This bill would have created the “Virginia Education Success Account Program,” a savings fund that would allow parents of currently enrolled public school students to divert public school funding in to a savings account that could be applied to private school tuition. This bill failed to pass the House.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Workplace Protections for Sexual Harassment Victims</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1895" target="_blank">HB1895</a> is heading to the Governor for action. This bill would prohibit non-disclosure agreements if they would bar discussion on past conduct, a problem that gained national attention when former Fox News Anchor, Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former employer. These contracts have prohibited victims of sexual harassment from pursuing legal justice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>My Bills</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Four of my bills are heading to the Governor. Three of these bills were brought to me by constituents and the fourth came from the Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission’s (JLARC) 2021 Affordable Housing Report.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1738" target="_blank">HB1738</a> seeks to ensure virtual public access is available for public meetings.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1744" target="_blank">HB1744</a> establishes transferability of home studies for adoption &amp; foster care processes.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The General Assembly adjourned today sine die, meaning the two bodies have completed their work. A conference report for the budget was passed that is being referred to as a “skinny budget.” This abbreviated conference report addresses pressing and required financial commitments for the state, but does not necessarily reflect a full compromise. Below is an update on the last week of session, the upcoming firehouse primary, and local news.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Vote in Tomorrow’s Firehouse Primary</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>There will be a firehouse primary Sunday, February 26, 9 AM - 6 PM</strong>. This election will select a democratic nominee to run in the Special Election on March 28 to fill the seat being vacated by Jennifer McClellan, who has just won election to the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tomorrow, voters will choose between Delegate Dawn Adams, Delegate Lamont Bagby, or Alexsis Rodgers. Polls are open 9 AM - 6 PM and locations are limited as this is a quickly organized election and is being administered by the Virginia Democratic Party. <strong>Any voter registered in the 9th Senate District and who considers themselves a Democrat can vote tomorrow.</strong> Valid proofs of identification are photo IDs such as a Driver’s License, or address-verifying documents such as payroll stubs, W2s, or a recent monthly bank statement.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Find polling locations below <strong>(note that IBEW 666 is no longer an available option)</strong> and more information on the firehouse primary <a href="https://vademocrats.org/sd9-special/" target="_blank">at this link.</a> If you are unsure whether you are in the 9th Senate District, use <a href="https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/" target="_blank">this link</a> to verify.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Session Update</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many House &amp; Senate bills that have differing forms are resolved by conferences. Conferences occur when a bill passes its house of origin, and then passes the other house, but with an amendment. If that amendment is rejected by the house of origin, then a conference is called to resolve the differences between the House &amp; Senate forms of the bill. Conferences consist of about 6 legislators (3 from each body) who are known as conferees. Five conferees must agree on a conference report which is given to each Clerk who distributes it to their body’s members. Then both the House &amp; Senate will vote on the conference report.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Legislators spent much of this past week working on conference reports. Yesterday and today many conference reports were finalized. One conference report that was agreed to today is this Session’s budget bill. The House &amp; Senate were unable to reach a substantive agreement due to the Governor’s introduced tax cuts over funding for education and healthcare, which were priorities in the Senate budget. Saturday’s conference report is a “skinny budget” that simply provides 4 urgent funding needs to meet State financial commitments.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The conference report includes the following:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over $250 million in funding for public education that reflects the combined impacts of technical adjustments to average daily membership (ADM), sales tax forecasts, and program participation rates. It also provides $16 million to ensure no school receives less funding than was communicated by the Department of Education due to <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/frustrated-youngkin-asks-assembly-to-use-necessary-resources-to-fix-school-aid-error/article_4e20d8b4-a263-11ed-ae98-7bf3ba6c75d6.html" target="_blank">their technical error.</a></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over $900 million in funding to the “rainy day fund” to meet constitutionally required deposits.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$250 million to the Virginia Retirement System to continue addressing unfunded liability.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">An additional $100 million to the Capital Supplement Pool to address supply chain issues and inflation that have been driving up the cost of previously approved capital projects. With this deposit, the supplement pool will have $450 million within it.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read a recap of the House &amp; Senate budget negotiations in <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/assembly-to-pass-skinny-budget-as-stopgap-measure/article_2fbe38f4-b540-11ed-a07b-97f8a4a7d73e.html" target="_blank">this article</a> from the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition to conference reports, we heard several retirement speeches from legislators.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may find Delegate Rob Bell’s (R-Albemarle, Chairman of the Courts of Justice Committee) retirement speech and reflections on his 22 year career to be an interesting look at the career of a legislator, the spirit of the General Assembly, and the historic grounding in which we root our work. You can find his retirement speech <a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230225/-1/18088?startposition=20230225115449&amp;viewMode=2&amp;globalStreamId=4" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition to Delegate Bell, the past two days have brought many retirement and farewell speeches. Other retirement speeches include:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Delegate Jeff Bourne will not seek re-election. He addressed the House Saturday.

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The General Assembly is nearing its scheduled adjournment and important issues are being settled. This past week was the last week that bills with financial implications could be heard and upcoming week will be the last week of session. By next week, the General Assembly will have finished our work and sent all legislation to the Governor’s desk; including the amended budget, judicial nominations, and hundreds of bills on a variety of subjects. Below is an update on where things stand.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Vote in the Special Election</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This coming <strong>Tuesday, February 21</strong>, is the special election to fill the seat left vacant by the passing of Congressman Donald McEachin. Voters registered in Congressional District 4 may vote and will choose between my friend and colleague, Senator Jennifer McClellan as the Democratic nominee, or Leon Benjamin, the Republican nominee.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can check your registration status as well as your polling place at <a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank">this website</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The House Budget</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The House &amp; Senate Budget Conferees are working to find a compromise between the two bodies’ conflicting budget reports. By the end of next week, the General Assembly will hopefully have found a compromise and communicate it with the Governor so he can consider amendments before acting on the budget.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was pleased to see a number of my budget amendments included and am hopeful to see them in the final budget. Among these were funding for:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Demolishing the old Worker’s Compensation building so the Science Museum can establish a greenspace in its place.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Virginia Holocaust Museum.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">American Civil War Museum.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Support for local libraries.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">IT infrastructure for the Library of Virginia.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, I had two language-only budget amendments. These amendments do not allocate new funds, but instead will provide information, directions, or guidelines by which already-appropriated money should be spent.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of my budget amendments will task VDOT to study the traffic at the I-95/Arthur Ashe Boulevard interchange for its current capability, as well as how it will perform with new development and growth in the area. I have heard from many Richmond residents about the dangerous, high-speed weaving, as well as the rush-hour traffic jams at this interchange. The underwhelming performance of the current interchange will only be exacerbated by projects like the Diamond District, which will bring more population density and commercial traffic. We need to ensure we are planning accordingly in order to keep our neighborhoods protected and our roadways safe.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My other language-only budget amendment is following-up on legislation I introduced last year. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB732" target="_blank">HB732</a> (2022 Session) set out to prevent public institutions of higher education from withholding student transcripts as a debt-collection tool for direct-to-school debt. There were concerns over data to support the breadth of these issues, so in lieu of my legislation’s passage, I ensured there would be a study to collect the targeted data. In light of this study, I introduced a budget amendment this Session which provides a surgical fix to the issue. My budget amendment requires institutions to release transcripts to students who owe less than $500 or who have enrolled in a payment plan and made three consecutive payments, or whose potential employers have requested the transcript.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>2023 Outstanding Virginian Award</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This past Monday, I was honored to present G. Gil Minor, III with a resolution commending him for his lifetime achievements and for receiving the Outstanding Virginian Award. You can watch my center-aisle presentation <a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230213/-1/16966?startposition=20230213123754&amp;viewMode=2&amp;globalStreamId=4" target="_blank">at this link</a> and can read Gil’s commending resolution <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HJ642" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Relevant Bills</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Requiring Car Insurance</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+cab+SC10206SB0951+RCSB3" target="_blank">SB951</a> has passed both the House and Senate and is heading to the Governor for review. This bill would remove the ability to register a car as uninsured, which currently carries a $500 fee. By removing the uninsured motorist fee, Virginia would join 48 other states in requiring auto insurance for registered vehicles.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Petersburg Casino</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1373" target="_blank">HB1373</a> was defeated in Senate Finance. This bill sought to add Petersburg to the list of cities that can have a referendum on whether or not to host a casino. Additionally, it would have limited Richmond on when it is able to hold another referendum on the subject. The Senate version of this bill failed to pass earlier this Session.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Bills from the Governor’s Commission on Antisemitism</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two bills (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1898" target="_blank">HB1898</a> &amp; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1606" target="_blank">HB1606</a>) from the Governor’s Commission to Combat Antisemitism were acted on by the Senate. HB1898 was defeated in Senate General Laws and HB1606 passed Senate Rules and will likely pass on the Senate floor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Automatic License Plate Readers</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A House &amp; Senate bill (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1437" target="_blank">HB1437</a> &amp; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB1165" target="_blank">SB1165</a>) were introduced this year to allow increased use of Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPRs) by having them placed by a private company in VDOT right of ways. These devices scan the license plates of traffic as it passes by, not for monitoring speed limits, tolls, or high occupancy vehicle requirements, but in case one of the license plates should become relevant in a law enforcement investigation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While, these devices can prove to be helpful in a variety of crime investigations, data privacy concerns have arisen. These bills provide authority to establish a statewide network of interconnected devices that collect and store millions of data points. There are concerns over this network being manipulated by artificial intelligence to track an innocent person’s movements.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Groups I’ve Met With This Past Week</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Athletic Trainers</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Richard Bland College Leadership</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marymount University Leadership</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">New Virginia Majority</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Open High School Students</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Charitable Gaming Operators</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Leadership</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Clean Energy Future</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dominion Energy Employees</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Psychiatric Society of Virginia</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Virginia Association of Naturopathic Physicians</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A number of constituents</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Issues on which I’ve heard the most from constituents:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fully funding the Standards of Quality for Public Schools</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Utility Rate Reform</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Petersburg Casino</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rural EV Infrastructure Program</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPRs)</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Governor’s Fellows Programs</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Governor Youngkin has opened the 2023 Governor’s Fellows Program. Applicants must be rising college seniors, graduating college seniors, or enrolled in a graduate degree program.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">More information is available <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/fellows/" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Freedom’s Path Movie</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Freedom’s Path</em>, a film centered on the Underground Railroad, is in theaters nationwide. It was produced by Richmond’s own BK Fulton and his production company Soulidfly. Delegate Charniele Herring also gave this movie a shoutout in her “moment of black history” floor speech this past Monday as she talked about the expansive and beautiful history of the Underground Railroad. You can watch her floor speech <a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230213/-1/16966?startposition=20230213123357&amp;viewMode=2&amp;globalStreamId=4" target="_blank">here</a> and learn more about the movie <a href="https://www.soulidifly.com/freedomspath" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Robert Lambeth Retirement</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Robert Lambeth, the President of the Council of Independent Colleges of Virginia (CICV) is retiring after serving in that role since 1983. His leadership has been invaluable for the 27 accredited, nonprofit private colleges CICV represents. Delegate Byron and I recognized him on the House Floor. You can watch my floor speech <a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230215/-1/16999?startposition=20230215120705&amp;viewMode=2&amp;globalStreamId=4" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Commending &amp; Memorial Resolutions</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Members of the General Assembly can do a variety of actions legislatively. One unique piece of legislation we can put forward is a commending or memorial resolution. These are official proclamations that recognize either the achievements of a group or individual, or that celebrate the life of someone who is no longer with us. These resolutions are agreed to by the House, with an option for other members to sign on as co-patrons. Additionally, some resolutions are known as “joint resolutions” and are heard in both the House and Senate with a patron from each body signed on to the legislation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This Session, I have introduced a variety of commending &amp; memorial resolutions. Among those I have introduced include:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Commending the Black History Museum on 40 years</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Commending the Library of Virginia on 200 years</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Celebrating the life of John Moeser, a founding member of VCU’s Urban &amp; Regional Studies and Planning Program, as well as an author, mentor, and advocate for more inclusive communities.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Commending Claire Guthrie Gastañaga on her leadership of the ACLU Virginia and her impressive career.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Commending G. Gil Minor, III on his receiving of the 2023 Outstanding Virginian Award, as mentioned above.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hundreds of resolutions are passed each session.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The House worked this week to pass their proposed amendments to the biennial budget. In addition, Tuesday was crossover, the final day for each legislative body to act on their bills before sending them to the other body. Below is an update on the budget and important bills still at play after crossover.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The House Budget</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On Sunday, the House Appropriations Committee met to present their committee reports; a collection of decisions on budget amendments brought by members of the House. These committee reports were then heard on the House floor on Thursday, where members had a chance to pose opposition to amendments as well as introduce additional amendments. The Senate has undergone the same process. The differences between the two budgets will be resolved in a conference.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was pleased to see a number of my budget amendments included. Among these were funding for:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Demolishing the old Worker’s Compensation building so the Science Museum can establish a greenspace in its place.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Virginia Holocaust Museum.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">American Civil War Museum.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Support for local libraries.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">IT infrastructure for the Library of Virginia.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Commonwealth Institute has provided a side-by-side analysis of the Governor’s introduced changes to the 2022-2024 biennial budget in comparison to the proposed changes by the House &amp; Senate. You can find the report <a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/research/session-2023-key-budget-policy-choices/" target="_blank">at this link.</a> Additionally, you can read more about the state budget <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/house-senate-adopt-budgets---the-real-battle-begins/article_efec5774-a8b0-11ed-9571-5f8dc814eae9.html" target="_blank">in this article</a> from the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em>. You can find subcommittee reports from both the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/sessionreports/2023/1/" target="_blank">at this link.</a> Below are highlighted some features of the House budget.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Tax Cuts</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The most distinct difference is in tax relief measures. The Governor’s proposal included $1 billion in tax relief, which the House largely preserved.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Senate excluded these large tax relief items in their budget. The House Democratic Caucus agrees with the Senate approach. Virginia is in a rare and privileged position with a large surplus of funds. These funds could go towards once-in-a-lifetime investments to properly fund and fix our schools, address our mental health crisis, improve our healthcare system, and give struggling communities desperately needed economic development investments.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While tax relief for individuals is a popular and understandable proposal, the Governor’s amendments do not necessarily prioritize working Virginians. His tax relief measures provide $350 million in tax cuts for large corporations while providing the average Virginian around $50 in tax relief.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>State Employee Pay Increases</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">State employees, including teachers, will receive a combined 7% raise; 5% coming from the original biennial budget and an additional 2% introduced in this budget.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is also significant money that state agencies will be provided for discretionary spending to address workforce development, employee retention, and wage compression.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Education</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The House and Senate budgets differ greatly in their spending for Virginia’s public schools. Below are several measures that are not found in the House budget.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Senate provides $1 billion in direct aid to local school divisions; $700 million more than the House budget does. The Senate also has appropriated $270 million in funding for support staff: non-teaching staff who provide crucial services to schools such as janitors, nurses, guidance counselors, and social workers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Finally, the Senate has also provided over $38 million for compensation of instructional assistants (compared to the House’s $3 million appropriation). Instructional assistants provide temporary, fill-in help, a position that has been vital for short-staffed schools facing a crisis of poor mental and behavioral student health.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Medicaid</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The House has appropriated $53.8 million and the Senate has appropriated $210 million to increase medicaid reimbursement rates for a number of positions such as personal care providers and youth mental health specialists, among many others.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These professions receive wages comparable to unskilled or entry-level jobs, yet these professions require certifications and trainings and are often very demanding. Their vital work saves the state money, provides better outcomes to patients, and expands access to Virginians.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Behavioral Health</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This budget provides $36.5 million for funding of behavioral health service centers that focus on a community-based approach rather than housing behavioral health services in large health institutions like hospitals.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Nursing Home Reform</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After two decades of failed attempts, a House bill is likely to pass this session that would carry a $62 million dollar budget investment to ensure nursing homes are properly staffed with nurses and aides. I was proud to carry a bill on this issue last year. Although the bill that passed the House this year is not perfect, it is a major step in the right direction.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Oyster Recycling Tax Credit</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A House bill established a nonrefundable tax credit for taxpayers who donate oyster shells to nonprofits that are engaged in oyster restoration projects.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Washington Commanders</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The House preserved Governor Youngkin’s $500,000 appropriation to the Secretary of Finance for the purposes of further studying the economic impacts of relocating the National Football League’s Washington Commanders into Virginia, from their current home in Landover, Maryland. The Senate did not include this provision.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Important Bills</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With crossover in the rear-view, many bills have failed and those remaining are under consideration by the other body. Several articles have been published with excellent recaps on crossover; like <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/08/mid-session-update-whats-still-alive-and-whats-dead-or-on-the-way-there/" target="_blank">this piece</a> from the <em>Virginia Mercury</em> as well as <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/here-is-where-25-key-issues-stand-after-crossover/article_f2489938-a7b6-11ed-b33e-ab6530ce97d4.html" target="_blank">this article</a> from the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Abortion</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Senate defeated all abortion bans and restrictions. The House did not put these bills on an agenda to protect their members who face close general elections from having a recorded vote on bills that would fail in the Senate regardless. Although I am relieved that these measures found no foothold, there is much work to be done. The Senate passed a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255&amp;231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank">constitutional amendment</a> that would put the right to reproductive freedom into the State Constitution. This legislation must pass the House and then do so again in the next Session. <strong>I will support this landmark legislation and am hopeful it will pass the House.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Transgender Youth</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two bills (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2432" target="_blank">HB2432</a> and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1387" target="_blank">HB1387</a>) targeting transgender youth passed the House on a narrow vote.<strong> I am hopeful that they will be defeated in the Senate.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Rate Reform</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A pair of Dominion backed bills (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1770" target="_blank">HB1770</a> &amp; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1265" target="_blank">SB1265</a>) have passed their respective bodies after numerous major amendments and substitutes. There is concern over the impact these bills will have on ratepayer bills and their implications for the Virginia Clean Economy Act.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A more simple pair (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1604" target="_blank">HB1604</a> &amp; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1321" target="_blank">SB1321</a>) have also passed their respective bodies and are likely to significantly lower ratepayer bills.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Bills from the Governor’s Commission on Antisemitism</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two bills (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1898" target="_blank">HB1898</a> &amp; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1606" target="_blank">HB1606</a>) from the Governor’s Commission to Combat Antisemitism have passed the House. I voted against HB1898. I voted in favor of HB1606 with the amendment from my colleague, Delegate Marcus Simon, which made this a section 1 bill and not included in the state code.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://richmond.com/opinion/columnists/column-antisemitism-bills-shouldnt-stifle-free-speech/article_d37a8f5a-a704-11ed-b4e3-0b9a17eb5487.html" target="_blank">This recent op-ed</a> from the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em> provides a compelling look at these pieces of legislation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Gun Safety</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Several important Senate bills to curtail the sale of firearms and strengthen storage laws were tabled in the House Committee for Public Safety. The Chair of the Subcommittee declined to allow testimony on the bills and promptly moved to table each of these bills that would have made our communities safer.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can find the agenda of the subcommittee meeting, with the bills considered, <a href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/agendas/agendaItem.php?id=3931" target="_blank">at this link</a>, and a recording of the meeting <a href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/chamber/chamberstream.php" target="_blank">at this link.</a> Finally, the <em>Virginia Mercury </em>published <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/09/va-house-refuses-to-take-testimony-on-gun-bills-as-revenge-against-democratic-senate/" target="_blank">an article </a>about this disappointing development.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Petersburg Casino</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1373" target="_blank">HB1373</a> passed the House by a narrow margin and is heading to the Senate. This bill seeks to add Petersburg to the list of cities that can have a referendum on whether or not to host a casino. Additionally, it limits Richmond on when it is able hold another referendum on the subject. The Senate version of this bill failed to pass.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>My Bills Heading to the Senate</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1738" target="_blank"><strong>HB1738</strong></a> seeks to ensure virtual public access is available for state and local meetings.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1744" target="_blank"><strong>HB1744</strong> </a>establishes reciprocity between among home studies done for adoption or foster care services.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1745" target="_blank"><strong>HB1745</strong></a><strong> </strong>is a consumer protection bill that prevents tow truck drivers from engaging in manipulative and coercive behaviors to take advantage of vulnerable, stranded drivers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1765" target="_blank"><strong>HB1765</strong></a> expands the definition of a fire company to include a company that provides rehabilitative services.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2046" target="_blank"><strong>HB2046</strong></a> tasks DHCD with a statewide housing needs assessment and plan to be done every 5 years.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Helpful Resources for Session</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Session convenes each day at noon.

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The General Assembly has concluded our last full week before Crossover next Tuesday. Crossover is the last day each body can act on their legislation before it must be sent to the other body for review. As such, this was a fast week with a lot of movement. Below is an update on my bills and other relevant legislation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Tyre Nichols</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last Friday, January 27, horrific body camera footage was released that showed a tragic beating by five Memphis policemen, of 29-year Tyre Nichols, who would succumb to his injuries three days later.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The reason for initial police interaction was a traffic stop. I am deeply disturbed by this and echo a sentiment from the Virginia Joint Democratic Caucuses and Virginia Legislative Black Caucus <a href="https://www.vasenatedems.com/news/virginia-joint-democratic-caucuses-and-the-virginia-legislative-black-caucus?emci=a4c370ad-349f-ed11-994c-00224832eb73&amp;emdi=056cd1e9-399f-ed11-994c-00224832eb73&amp;ceid=1261019" target="_blank">press release</a> that “a system in which a traffic stop ends with someone murdered is a system that is deeply broken.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Systematic change is obviously required to prevent situations such as these. In the meantime, my colleagues and I in the House have been working hard to defend progress we have made. Last Thursday, I voted to defeat <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1401" target="_blank">HB1401</a> which would have repealed the Community Policing Act.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>House Appropriations Presents Budget</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sunday, February 5, at 1 PM, the House Appropriations Committee will present its proposed budget report, which will be considered on the House floor later next week.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can watch the presentation live <a href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/chamber/chamberstream.php" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Important Bills</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Short Term Rentals</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HB2271 was heard in Subcommittee #2 of Counties, Cities, and Towns. The subcommittee unanimously moved to defeat this bill. The Senate companion, SB1391, was similarly defeated.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hearing a lot of concern from my constituents and Richmond area communities, I actively advocated against this bill and was pleased that it failed to pass. These sorts of measures should be left to localities.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>LGBTQ Youth Bills</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two bills (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2432" target="_blank">HB2432</a> and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1387" target="_blank">HB1387</a>) targeting transgender youth will be up for a vote on the House floor next week. <strong>I will oppose these bills.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Rate Reform</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dominion is backing a House and Senate bill that will likely result in increases in ratepayer bills. Both pieces of legislation have moved to their respective floors after extensive discussion and amendments. At present, I will oppose these bills over concerns of increasing energy bills and the negative implications they may have on the Virginia Clean Economy Act.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A more simple proposal (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1604" target="_blank">HB1604</a>) that allows oversight for utility rates has passed the Commerce &amp; Energy Committee and is heading to the House Floor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Bills from the Governor’s Commission on Antisemitism</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I will always fight antisemitism and stand strong against bigotry and hatred. I am very supportive and appreciative of the work of the Jewish Community Federation in Richmond and those around the Commonwealth. I have worked to combat antisemitism through my service on the Virginia Holocaust Museum (VHM) board as well as introductions of state budget amendments for the VHM. The Holocaust Museum provides comprehensive, age appropriate in-depth education about the Holocaust and the dangers of all bigotry. We must continue to address the abhorrent rise of antisemitism and hate-crimes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Several bills were introduced this year that originated from the Governor’s Commission to Combat Antisemitism. Two bills are on the House floor, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1898" target="_blank">HB1898</a> &amp; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Hb1606" target="_blank">HB1606</a>. The first would prevent the state from contracting with companies that have participated in a boycott of Israel. The second bill implements the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of anti-semitism into State code.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HB1606 seeks to implement the IHRA’s working definition of antisemitism into state code as a tool for education and public safety. I am supportive of this bill and of clarifying the definition of antisemitism, which will greatly benefit education and training measures and will ensure that antisemitic crimes can be properly prosecuted.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HB1898 addresses a much more complicated issue and there is not even consensus among the Jewish community members concerning this bill. I heard from some constituents that this bill advanced a necessary discussion on the clear and present threat of antisemitism nationally. On the other hand, I heard from many other constituents who were concerned that HB1898 unfairly punished individuals and businesses who sought to express concerns with Israeli foreign policy, without directing comments towards Jewish people themselves.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Bipartisan Efforts in the General Assembly</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The House of Delegates has been working on a bipartisan effort to pass important legislative initiatives for the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia. <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/amid-sharpening-partisan-divisions-some-legislators-find-consensus/article_fa57966c-a25f-11ed-a2a5-4757f85d6519.html"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Here </span></a>you can find an article from the Richmond Times-Dispatch that shows some of the work Democrats and Republicans have completed to achieve legislative success for their constituents.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Constitutional Amendments</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">20 constitutional amendments will not be heard in the House Privileges and Elections Committee, including my <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HJ498" target="_blank">HJ498</a> which would have established an optional tax relief program for localities to protect their longtime owner-occupants from steep property taxes. You can read more about the other constitutional amendments being left in committee <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/va-house-wont-take-up-20-constitutional-amendments-still-pending-in-committee/" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Bills I Presented</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This past week, I presented the remainder of my bills in their respective committees. Below is an update on them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1738" target="_blank"><strong>HB1738</strong></a> seeks to ensure virtual public access is required for state and local meetings. This bill was reported and referred from General Laws to Appropriations for fiscal analysis. The bill passed Appropriations 22-0 and will be read on the House floor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1744" target="_blank"><strong>HB1744</strong> </a>establishes reciprocity between home studies done for adoption or foster care services. A constituent presented the idea for this bill to me and I was thrilled to introduce this legislation which will provide clarity and reduce financial barriers associated with the adoption and foster care process. This bill will be up for a vote on the House floor on Monday.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1765" target="_blank"><strong>HB1765</strong></a> expands the definition of fire company to include companies that provide rehabilitative services. This bill was brought to me by the Metro Richmond Flying Squad and passed General Laws by a vote of 21-1 and will be on the House floor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1774" target="_blank"><strong>HB1744</strong></a><strong> </strong>sought to establish harm reduction training standards for law enforcement. This bill was the result of conversations with Beth Macy (Author &amp; Journalist known for <em>Dopesick </em>and <em>Raising Lazarus</em>) as well the Virginia Harm Reduction Coalition, both of whom provided testimony at the subcommittee. It was defeated in subcommittee by a vote of 5-3. I look forward to continuing to work on this topic.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2045" target="_blank"><strong>HB2045</strong></a> directs the Department of Housing and Community Development to create an incentive program for localities who adopt certain affordable housing practices. Although it passed the General Laws Committee unanimously, there was a question over some specific implementation and necessary funding. Accordingly, it was sent to Appropriations and will be considered by the Virginia Housing Commission going forward.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2046" target="_blank"><strong>HB2046</strong></a> tasks DHCD with a statewide housing needs assessment and plan to be done every 5 years. This bill passed General Laws and Appropriations unanimously and is heading to the House floor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virginia Board of Education</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This past Thursday, the Board of Education adopted a second rewriting of the K-12 history standards that were provided by Governor Youngkin’s administration. These standards have been sharply criticized for their accuracy, their fairness in reporting, and their quality. Issues range from removing the word “facism” from the section on World War II, as well as removing teachings on labor union history, and the history of Indigenous peoples before European settlement.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These standards were adopted as a basis for the board to begin tweaking. These standards will go through a public comment period, with 6 hearings scheduled throughout the month of March. Find the notices of these hearings <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewNotice.cfm?gnid=2537" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Department of Education Funding Error</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Department of Education made an error in their online calculation tool that local school districts use to anticipate funding and plan their budgets. This error led to local schools expecting a total of $200 million more than what they are set to receive. Schools that rely most on this state aid are in rural and poorer school districts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Governor Youngkin has asked the General Assembly to fix this funding error in their budget bill. Read more about this issue <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/frustrated-youngkin-asks-assembly-to-use-necessary-resources-to-fix-school-aid-error/article_4e20d8b4-a263-11ed-ae98-7bf3ba6c75d6.html" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Richmond City Charter Review Commission</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The City will hold a meeting of its City Charter Review Commission this coming Wednesday, February 8, 6-8 PM. All citizens are invited and encouraged to attend.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The meeting will be on the 5th floor conference room at City Hall (900 East Broad Street). More information is available <a href="https://richmondvacitycouncil.blogspot.com/2023/02/richmond-city-charter-review-commission.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Helpful Resources for Session</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Session convenes each day at noon.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The General Assembly has wrapped its second full week of Session. Many bills were heard this week as Virginia’s famously fast legislative process forged forward. There are now less than two weeks for each body of the General Assembly to act on their offered legislation before they must be sent to the other body. Following is an update on some relevant issues being considered, a look at the bills I presented and some other state and local news.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Library of Virginia’s 200th Anniversary</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Library of Virginia celebrated its 200th anniversary this past Tuesday, January 24. In honor of this monumental date, I moved passage of a commending resolution for the Library and gave remarks in the center aisle of the House floor, accompanied by Sandra Treadway (Librarian of Virginia), Paul Brockwell (Chairman of the Library of Virginia Board) and Pia Trigiani (Chair of the Library of Virginia Foundation Board). You can watch a recording of my center aisle presentation <a href="https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00304/harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230124/-1/15794?startposition=20230124123514&amp;viewMode=2&amp;globalStreamId=4" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Important Bills</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This past week, several important bills have been introduced and heard.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Short Term Rentals</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HB2271 &amp; SB1391 were introduced. HB2271 was scheduled to be heard Thursday morning; however the subcommittee moved to take it by for the week so amendments could be considered.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These two bills were introduced to set-up short-term rentals that are operated by Virginia licensed realtors. Although the intent of this bill was to insulate only Virginia realtors (a relatively small group of current short term rental operators), the current bill disregards local governments, who know what is best for their communities and neighborhoods.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I agree with the many concerns I have heard from community associations and prioritize the primacy of Richmond’s on-going discussions and ordinances on short term rentals. I will oppose this bill in its current form. These types of decisions should be left to localities.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Clean Economy Bills</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This week, the House passed a bill to repeal Virginia’s clean car standards, which were adopted in 2021 and aim for a ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This repeal is now going to the Senate who voted this week to kill bills that repeal Virginia’s engagement in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Virginia Mercury published a helpful round-up of clean energy bills that are still at play in the General Assembly. You can read <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/26/these-bills-could-bring-more-clean-energy-to-your-community/" target="_blank">it here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Gun Safety Bills</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On Thursday night, Public Safety Subcommittee #1 heard and defeated a number of important gun safety bills, including an assault firearm ban. These bills would have made our communities, schools, and homes safer. You can find the subcommittee’s agenda <a href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/agendas/agendaItem.php?id=3802" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Abortion</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Bans and restrictions of abortion have not been heard in the House yet; however, the Senate has voted defeated three abortion restricting bills.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There have been ancillary bills not directed at abortion, but seeking to set dangerous precedents. HB1894 is an example of such a bill. It sought to establish pregnant women as two people for the purposes of HOV roads. It came before my colleagues and me in the Transportation committee, where it was voted down unanimously.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Animal Testing in Laboratories</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two bills were introduced to protect animals used in lab testing. HB2348 increases penalties for facilities that violate the federal Animal Welfare Act. This bill was reported from the Agriculture committee and referred to the Appropriations Committee by a vote of 6-4.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HB2042 established whistleblower protections for those speaking out on mistreatment of animals used in a lab setting. This bill failed to pass (5-4).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Clockwise from top left: Virginia Human Rights Coalition, President Rao of VCU, Virginia Nurse Midwives Association, Virginia Assisted Living Association.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Bills I Presented</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Since Session began, I have presented 8 bills. Below is an update on each.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1738</strong> seeks to ensure virtual public access is required for state and local meetings. This bill was reported and referred from General Laws to Appropriations for fiscal analysis.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1743 </strong>attempted to ensure responsible contracting practices were required in state public procurement bids, continuing the focus on preventing wage theft and irresponsible contracting in State projects. This bill failed to report from its General Laws subcommittee.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1745 </strong>is my consumer protection bill to prevent predatory towing practices. It reported from its subcommittee unanimously and eventually passed the House by a vote of 94-6. It now must move through the Senate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1744</strong> establishes reciprocity between home studies done for adoption or foster care services. A constituent presented the idea for this bill to me and I was thrilled to introduce this legislation which will provide clarity and reduce financial barriers associated with the adoption and foster care process. This bill reported from the Health, Welfare, and Institutions Subcommittee #1 unanimously.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1785 </strong>would have allowed certain localities to lower their speed limits below 25 mph. This bill failed to report from subcommittee over concerns that this would create an unprecedented situation. City leaders brought this idea to me and although it did not pass, I believe it was valuable for state lawmakers and officials from VDOT to hear about the severity of speeding in the Commonwealth, especially within and in the Richmond area.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1742</strong>, known as “No Child Left Inside,” sought to create an environmental literacy curriculum and fund to engage students with their physical environment and prepare them with the necessary environmental literacy to understand the unique challenges the Commonwealth will face as a result of climate change. Additionally, this outdoor engagement improves student behavior and academic performance. Unfortunately, the bill failed to report from subcommittee due to funding concerns.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1773 </strong>brought results from three studies (one each from State Police, AAA, and VDOT) to codify the bike safety stop, a traffic practice that permits cyclists to treat certain stop signs as yield signs. A number of constituents emailed and called me with their support. This bill failed to report from Transportation Subcommittee #3.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB2046 </strong>is the first of my affordable housing bills to be heard which implement JLARC recommendations. It seeks to create an incentive program under the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) that would provide grants to localities who adopt affordable housing zoning policies. General Laws Subcommittee #2 recommended reporting and referring to Appropriations by an unanimous vote.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>My Budget Amendments</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The budget amendments submitted by House and Senate members are available for public access online. You can view them <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Citizens in North Side, Rosedale, Sherwood Park, Scott’s Addition, and Carver are concerned about how the Diamond District development may affect the current Arthur Ashe Boulevard/I-95 interchange. I submitted a budget amendment that requests VDOT to study the traffic impact along this interchange.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, I introduced budget amendments for the Virginia Holocaust Museum, the American Civil War Museum, the Virginia Repertory Theater, and Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden to help these institutions better provide educational programming and resources for the Commonwealth’s students.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am carrying budget amendments to support state employees by converting the Governor’s proposed bonus into a permanent wage increase and also providing a one-time cost of living adjustment for Virginia retirees to combat rampant inflation. I also submitted budget amendments to increase reimbursement rates for personal healthcare providers, who play a vital role in our communities.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Library of Virginia has important funding needs for their IT infrastructure as well as for better support to local libraries; I submitted budget requests to address both. I also submitted budget amendments to support local parks and to support localities impacted by flooding.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Helpful Resources for Session</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Session convenes each day at noon. You can watch a live stream and recordings of previous sessions and committee meetings <a href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/chamber/chamberstream.php" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can find copies of introduced bills and track their progress <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=lnk&amp;val=71" target="_blank">at this website.</a> Additionally, under the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+oth+MTG" target="_blank">meeting tab</a> of that website, you can find the schedule for committees, caucuses, commissions and session.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you would like to testify in favor or opposition of a bill either virtually or in-person, you can sign up to do so <a href="https://hodspeak.house.virginia.gov/" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reading a bill is a skill that can take some time to develop. Review the below graphic for help on how.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Finally, the language of session can be tricky, see below for a glossary of some common terms and motions used in session and in committees.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Definitions of Common Terms &amp; Motions</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Patron: </strong>The Delegate or Senator who introduces a bill</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Co-Patron: </strong>The Delegate or Senator who supports the bill</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>First Reading: </strong>The bill is placed on the House floor calendar</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Second Reading: </strong>The bill is open for discussion on the House floor</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Third Reading: </strong>The bill is voted on the House floor</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Crossover: </strong>When all the bills that passed one body (House or Senate) “crossover” to the other body</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Sine Die: </strong>The House and Senate have completed their work and session adjourns</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Committee motions:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Report: </strong>This motion is made to vote on the passage of a bill in committee.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Refer: </strong>This motion is made when a bill is being reported and referred to another committee for review and consideration.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Pass by for the Day: </strong>When a bill is still up for consideration but the committee or the patron need more time to work on the bill.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The new year is underway and the 2023 legislative session is in full swing. Session convened on January 11 and is scheduled to be a 45 day session. During this time, the General Assembly will consider over a 1,500 bills as well as Governor Youngkin’s amendments to the biennial budget that covers state spending from fiscal years 2022-2024. Below, I provide more insight into the going-ons of session, my legislation, and helpful resources.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>State of the Commonwealth Address</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Governor Youngkin gave his 2023 State of the Commonwealth address on January 11, after the first day of session.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read his remarks <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/january/name-979187-en.html" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The 2023 Legislative Session</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Session convened January 11, 2023, at 12 noon, with an expected adjournment on February 25.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are several important topics that will be debated during this session, in addition to thorough deliberation for the best use for Virginia’s surplus funds. Below, I will highlight some important topics and link to helpful articles.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Abortion</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Governor has made it clear he wants to prioritize legislation that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. A <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2278" target="_blank">House</a> and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1385" target="_blank">Senate</a> bill have been introduced in line with the Governor’s priorities. However, these are not the only bills on the subject. There has also been legislation introduced to put in code that <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1395" target="_blank">life begins at conception</a> as well as other measures to ban abortion and restrict access to reproductive healthcare.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I will vote against any of these measures and support accessible, confidential, and quality healthcare for all Virginians.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Environmental Protections</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Virginia passed three substantial pieces of environmental legislation in 2020 and 2021. These bills committed Virginia to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), outlined the process for transitioning to a carbon neutral energy economy with the Virginia Clean Economy Act, and committed Virginia to clean car standards.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This session, there are a myriad of bills which aim to undermine these environmental protections, and in some cases seek to repeal them entirely. I will continue to champion our environment and oppose bills that undo our important work.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Virginia Mercury published a helpful round-up of environmental legislation under discussion this session. You can find it <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/18/attacks-on-virginias-climate-laws-are-front-and-center-at-the-general-assembly/" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Gun Violence Prevention</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are several bills to prevent gun violence. Including legislation that would study the effect gun violence has on communities, ban the sale of unserialized “ghost guns,” and strengthen gun storage laws. These measures are vital to ensuring our communities, students and families are safe. I look forward to supporting these pieces of legislation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Education</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Governor Youngkin and several Republican members have initiated legislation to undermine public schools.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Utility Rate Reform</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Several bills have been introduced to lower the high power bills Virginians have been paying. These bills are divided in two approaches. One which provides a simple change to allow the State Corporation Commission to review Dominion’s base rates and adjust them as needed. The other bills are a more complicated approach on the issue that address a variety of rules and regulations placed on Dominion, including a provision that has allowed Dominion to reinvest profits into new projects rather than return them to ratepayers. The latter suite of legislation is backed by Dominion and has drawn criticism for eroding State Corporation Commission authority over Dominion.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read more about these reforms <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/10/electric-utility-rate-reform-back-on-general-assembly-agenda/" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Governor’s Proposed Budget Amendments</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Commonwealth Institute published their analysis of Governor Youngkin’s proposed budget amendments to the Biennial budget for fiscal years 2022-2024. You can read their helpful side-by-side report <a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/research/session-2023-key-budget-policy-choices/" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>My Bills</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am excited to carry a variety of bills this session. You can find a complete list of bills that I have introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+mbr+H212C" target="_blank">at this link.</a> Several are highlighted below.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB2047: Inclusionary Zoning Practices</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This year, I am introducing several bills that implement recommendations from a 2021 Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission (JLARC) study. HB2047 provides a menu of options that localities can adopt in support of affordable housing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB2045: Incentive Program for Localities</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HB2045 instructs the Department of Housing &amp; Community Development (DHCD) to create an incentive program for localities that adopt inclusionary zoning practices by awarding them grants to be used for housing or other infrastructure projects.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB2046: Statewide Housing Plan</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another JLARC bill, HB2046 tasks DHCD with creating and maintaining a statewide housing needs and assessment study to better instruct policy decisions moving forward.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HJ498: LOOP Constitutional Amendment</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HJ498 is a constitutional amendment that would give localities the ability to establish a Longtime Owner Occupancy Program (LOOP) to provide tax relief to residents who have been in their homes for an extended period of time, but may not qualify for the senior tax deduction.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1738: Virtual Public Access</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This bill ensures that the public is able to access state and local meetings remotely. It was heard in subcommittee, who recommended referral to Appropriations to analyze its fiscal impact.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1742: No Child Left Inside</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This bill tasks the Department of Education with compiling a core curriculum of environmental literacy programs for K-12 education. Engaging children outside of the classroom environment helps support better focus and behavior. It also is vital to ensure the Commonwealth’s next generation is equipped for the unique challenges posed by climate change and environmental preservation. Principal Powell’s program at John B. Cary Elementary is illustrative of what can be accomplished through an environmental literacy program.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1744: Home Study Reciprocity for Adoption &amp; Foster Care</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HB1744 allows for transferability of home studies done for families seeking to adopt or foster. This bill aims to simplify the process for families looking to adopt or foster children who need families.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1745: Predatory Towing</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HB1745 is a consumer protection bill which adds to the prohibited acts for tow truck drivers and recovery operators. This bill will prevent non-contracted tow-truck drivers, whose prices are not capped, from taking advantage of vulnerable, stranded drivers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1765: Rehabilitative Support Services for Firefighters</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This bill seeks to expand the definition of a fire company to include those companies who provide rehabilitative support services to first-responders at on-going emergency scenes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1773: Bike Safety</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This bill clarifies code to allow for bicycles to treat certain stop signs as yield signs, which is a practice that is recommended by a recent state police study.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1774: Harm Reduction Training for Law Enforcement</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">HB1774 implements expanded harm reduction training for law enforcement to help respond to the ongoing opioid epidemic.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>HB1785: Reducing Speed Limits</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This bill allows localities to lower their speed limits below 25 mph if they choose.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Committees &amp; Caucuses</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This session I continue to serve on the General Laws, Transportation, and Appropriations Committees.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition to legislative committee meetings and appointments with constituents and special interest groups, legislators participate in special caucuses during the session. For instance, the Military and Veterans Caucus and the Sportsmen Caucus meet one early morning each week.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We learned that Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) has been identified in deer in Virginia posing threats to our wildlife and recreational economy. If you hunt or enjoy eating venison, you may want to check <a href="https://dwr.virginia.gov/wildlife/diseases/cwd/" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At the Military and Veterans Caucus we learned, among other things, how Virginia's National Guard will be sending troops soon to Eastern Europe for the first time in a number of years.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Helpful Resources for Session</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Session convenes each day at noon. You can watch a live stream and recordings of previous sessions and committee meetings <a href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/chamber/chamberstream.php" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can find copies of introduced bills and track their progress <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=lnk&amp;val=71" target="_blank">at this website.</a> Additionally, under the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+oth+MTG" target="_blank">meeting tab</a> of that website, you can find the schedule for committees, caucuses, commissions and session.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you would like to testify in favor or opposition of a bill either virtually or in-person, you can sign up to do so <a href="https://hodspeak.house.virginia.gov/" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reading a bill is a skill that can take some time to develop. Review the below graphic for help on how.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Finally, the language of session can be tricky, see below for a glossary of some common terms and motions used in session and in committees.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Definitions of Common Terms &amp; Motions</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Patron: </strong>The Delegate or Senator who introduced a bill</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Co-Patron: </strong>The Delegate or Senator who supports the bill</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>First Reading: </strong>The bill is placed on the House floor calendar</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Second Reading: </strong>The bill is open for discussion on the House floor</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Third Reading: </strong>The bill is voted on the House floor</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Crossover: </strong>When all the bills that passed one body (House or Senate) “crossover” to the other body</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Sine Die: </strong>The House and Senate have completed their work and session adjourns</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Committee motions:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Report: </strong>This motion is made to vote on the passage of a bill in committee.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Refer: </strong>This motion is made when a bill is being reported and referred to another committee for review and consideration.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Pass by for the Day: </strong>When a bill is still up for consideration but the committee or the patron need more time to work on the bill. It is considered again during the next committee meeting.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Happy New Year! I hope you have enjoyed holiday observances and found time to rest and reflect in this busy time of year. I wish you a healthy, happy and fulfilling 2023 for you and your loved ones.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last week’s strong winter wind resulted in numerous power outages across the State. Review <a href="https://www.ready.gov/winter-weather" target="_blank">this website</a> to make sure you are prepared for the rest of the winter season.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Below are updates on important state and local news that I hope are helpful.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>VA-04 Special Election Results</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Congratulations to my friend, Jennifer McClellan! On December 20, she won a resounding victory in the Democratic primary to fill the seat of the late Congressman Donald McEachin. While we all miss him, I know she will be an excellent representative. Please plan to vote in the February 21 special election.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Despite a very short timeframe because of the Governor’s Writ of Election, as well as a very cold day, almost 28,000 voters braved long lines and made their voices heard.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am very proud of this turnout and am confident that Jennifer McClellan will continue Congressman McEachin’s legacy and represent Richmond in Congress with the same commitment to character, Democratic principles and her constituents that she has brought to the State Houses for the past 17 years.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Congratulations again, Jennifer, for such an impressive win, with close to 85% of the vote.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can view the full results by polling location below.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Governor Introduces his Proposed Budget</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Governor Youngkin presented his budget ahead of the 2023 Session. You can read his proposed budget <a href="http://publicreports.dpb.virginia.gov/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=BDOC2023_FrontPage" target="_blank">at this link</a> or you can watch the Governor’s remarks <a href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/chamber/chamberstream.php" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In Virginia, the Governor proposes a budget ahead of the Legislative Session. During Session, both the House and Senate members offer amendments and create their version of the budget bill. The budget agreed to by the General Assembly is then sent to the Governor’s desk for action.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here are some of the priority items in this budget as introduced by the Governor. For specific questions in regard to the budget, do not hesitate to email me at <a href="mailto:delegate.carr@betsycarr.org?subject=null&amp;body=null">delegate.carr@betsycarr.org</a> or to call my office at 804-698-1069.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Tax Cuts</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This budget builds on $4 billion in tax cuts that were agreed to in this year’s Session when the 2022-2024 biennial budget was passed. Governor Youngkin’s proposal will add another $1 billion in tax cuts by lowering the top individual income tax bracket’s rate from 5.75% down to 5.5%. Additionally, the proposal lowers the corporate tax from 6% to 5%. These two cuts account for over $700 million of the $1 billion of relief. The remaining $300 million of tax relief comes from small business tax relief, increases in the standard income tax deduction and other initiatives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Behavioral Health Services</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The proposed budget includes funding to address gaps in mental and behavioral health services in Virginia, specifically, programs that offer solutions that do not require emergency rooms and hospitals. There is $80 million in funding for mobile crisis units and receiving facilities for those in crisis. There is also $9 million for expanding tele-health services in schools and universities as well as another $9 million for transportation and monitoring by law enforcement.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Combined Sewer Overflow</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is a much-needed $100 million for Richmond to prevent the City’s sewer from overflowing into the river during heavy rains.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Project-Ready Sites</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$450 million is allotted in the proposed budget for site development to increase Virginia’s stock of priority project sites. Youngkin’s administration postulates that Virginia’s lack of site readiness has hindered Virginia’s ability to secure large manufacturing facility projects.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>School Choice &amp; Other Education Initiatives</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Governor Youngkin campaigned on a promise to promote school choice in Virginia. Last session, $100 million was allocated for laboratory schools: a partnership between a school district and an institution of higher learning. His proposed budget will provide another $50 million for this initiative.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition to lab schools, this budget would provide $21 million to expand the dual enrollment program, $7 million and $17 million, respectively, for math and reading specialists, and $10 million for incentive payments for teachers to mitigate a growing teacher shortage.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Expansion of the Resilient Virginia Revolving Loan Fund</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last Session, the General Assembly established the Resilient Virginia Revolving Loan Fund, with $25 million in seed-funds from Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). This fund provides a flexible alternative to the Community Flood Preparedness Fund for localities to tackle flooding. With the Governor’s proposed withdrawal from RGGI, he included $200 million over two years in taxpayer dollars for the Revolving Loan Fund to offset the loss of RGGI dollars.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Washington Commanders Relocation</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Governor’s proposed budget includes $500,000 for the Secretary of Finance to further investigate Virginia’s bid for the Washington Commanders National Football League franchise relocating to Virginia.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Hemp-Derived Product Inspection</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The budget includes $2.1 million for a product inspection program for products that contain hemp-derived compounds like delta-8 THC. This is an effort to bolster consumer protection from unintended consumption.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Abortion Restriction</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Governor Youngkin’s proposed budget included $50,000 that is expected to be tied to upcoming legislation that will ban abortions after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. Bills that include any expansion to law enforcement often carry a minimum budget impact of $50,000, often times more. Youngkin’s inclusion of this in the budget is to make it easier for such legislation to pass.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am a staunch supporter of reproductive rights and accessible healthcare. I will vote against any legislation that undermines reproductive healthcare or restricts access.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Preview of 2023 Session</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The next Legislative Session convenes on January 11, at noon and is expected to adjourn on February 25. During Session, all members of the House and Senate come to Richmond to consider bills that hopefully will improve citizens’ lives. The budget bill is the most important of these.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Session moves fast and I will do my best to keep you updated on what is happening in the General Assembly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read the bills that have been introduced so far <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+men+BIL" target="_blank">here</a> and find the General Assembly meeting calendar <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+oth+MTG" target="_blank">here.</a> You can watch a live feed of Session, beginning January 11, at 12 PM, as well as previous recordings<a href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/chamber/chamberstream.php" target="_blank"> at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I plan to introduce a range of bills this year including:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Affordable Housing:</strong> Several pieces of legislation to bolstering affordable housing efforts in Virginia. These implement some JLARC (Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission) recommendations. Additionally, I plan to introduce the LOOP (Longtime Owner Occupant Program) constitutional amendment which will provide tax relief for residents who have been in their house for a substantial amount of time, but may not qualify for the senior citizen tax relief.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>No Child Left Inside:</strong> Supporting environmental literacy programs in schools that connect students with their physical environments outside of the classroom.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virtual public access:</strong> Ensuring that Virginians can know what’s happening in their government.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Responsible Contracting:</strong> Creating Fair labor standards for state construction projects.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Mitigating Predatory Towing Practices</strong></p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Harm Reduction Training &amp; Education: </strong>To combat the ongoing opiate epidemic.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Rehabilitative Services for Firefighters: </strong>Expanding a fire company definition to include support crews who offer rehabilitative support at active emergency scenes to decrease fatigue-related death and injury among first-responders.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Support for Foster and Adoptive Parents: </strong>Home study reciprocity.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once my bills are available online, I will share them with you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have legislative priorities, questions or concerns to share with me, email me at <a href="mailto:delegate.carr@betsycarr.org?subject=null&amp;body=null">delegate.carr@betsycarr.org</a> or call my office at 804-698-1069.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>JLARC Reports</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission (JLARC), of which I am a member, met to hear presentations from JLARC staff on December 12.

There is funding to continue the program until 2025.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">GRTC cited a 15% increase in ridership and the importance of regional connectivity as the motivating factors to make this decision.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was pleased to see this extension to ensure that all Richmonders have access to mass transit– good for the community, good for the climate!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virginia Department of Health Streamlines COVID-19 Dashboard</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has streamlined the COVID-19 data dashboard for ease of reference to relevant metrics and to conform to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting methods.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can find a full breakdown on the changes to the dashboard at <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/virginia-department-of-health-updates-reporting-schedule-for-covid-19-dashboards-and-other-retirements/" target="_blank">this VDH press release</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Dominion Bill Assistance</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dominion Energy provides several bill payment assistance programs for its customers.

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The days are shorter and the holidays are right around the corner. I hope you find time to relax, enjoy time with loved ones and celebrate any holidays you may observe. Following is an update on the elections, state legislative news and local news.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Top left: greeting early-morning voters with Councilwoman Jordan. Top right and bottom: speaking with voters.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Tragedy at the University of Virginia</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As many were across the Commonwealth, I was devastated to learn about the deaths of three University of Virginia students, and the injuries of two others, resulting from gun violence late on Sunday night. My deepest condolences are with the families of the victims and the UVa community.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Election Day Results</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last Tuesday, Virginians voted for their congressional representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. For residents of Richmond, Congressman Donald McEachin remains our congressional representative. Nationally, Democrats lost 8 seats in the House and 1 in the Senate. The Senate race in Georgia will head to a run-off election and 5 House races have yet to be called.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Virginia Public Access Project’s “After Virginia Votes” discussion provides in-depth analysis for Virginia’s elections. You can watch the discussion, which was streamed this past Tuesday, <a href="https://www.vpap.org/about-us/events/after-virginia-votes-2022/" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>JLARC Reports</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On Monday, the Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission (JLARC) met to give another round of reports. This time, they presented their findings on higher education financial aid grant programs, the pandemic’s effect on K-12 education, and Virginia529’s surplus fund.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch </em>summarized and discussed JLARC’s findings on the pandemic’s effect on K-12 education <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/virginia-report-documents-steep-learning-loss-teacher-departures/article_e1abd479-42a6-59e1-b592-6ce6142b5297.html" target="_blank">in this article</a>. It is clear that we need to prioritize our student’s mental health and support our teachers. Student behavioral issues and teacher workforce development are pressing issues that need to be resolved in order to ensure our Commonwealth’s students are reaching their full potential.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can watch the full JLARC presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6FwkgaPBBZ4o-Kzg90-PJQ" target="_blank">at this link</a> and <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/reports.asp" target="_blank">read their reports here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Clockwise from top left: Senator Mark Warner at the Richmond Ambulane Authority to send an ambulance off to Ukraine, Major General Timothy Williams, Cheryl Williams, and Senator Ghazala Hashmi at the Virginia War Memorial for the Commonwealth’s Veteran’s Day Celebrations, “Ambulances for Ukraine” with Chip Decker (CEO of Richmond Ambulance Authority) and Councilwoman Katherine Jordan, Discussing affordable housing legislation with the Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission staff, the Department of Housing &amp; Community Development staff, Virginia Realtors Association, Homebuilders Association of Virginia and the Virginia Housing Coalition.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Board of Education Rejects Youngkin’s Proposed Changes</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yesterday, the Board of Education rejected Governor Youngkin’s proposed changes to the K-12 history standards. The Governor’s proposed changes were an inappropriate attempt to whitewash history, even going as far as to mislabel Native Americans as “America’s first immigrants.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Although I am encouraged that this draft was rejected, it will be revised and voted on again. I am hopeful that we will not shield our children from uncomfortable truths and that we will prioritize an accurate account of history. Failing to do so only ensures that the of yesterday’s misdeeds pervade our tomorrow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Appropriations Committee Retreat</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This past Monday, November 14, the Appropriations Committee met to hear reports from staff and Commonwealth official. The presentations included reports on “business-ready sites,” inflation and supply chain issues, as well as the State’s revenue, debt and capital outlay.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can view the presentations <a href="https://hac.virginia.gov/" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Hunt Institute Education Conference</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At the end of October, I attended the Hunt Institute’s 2022 Virginia Education Summit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I heard enlightening reports on topics such as reassessing student evaluations in higher education, free-speech on college campuses and the pros and cons of linking post-secondary funding to state-measured metrics.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can read the key takeaways of all the summit’s presentations <a href="https://hunt-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022-Virginia-Education-Summit.Key-Takeaways.Final_.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and view other Hunt Institute Publications <a href="https://hunt-institute.org/resources/" target="_blank">on their website.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Clockwise from top left: Elizabeth &amp; Steve Yeakel at the Richmond Public Schools Shines Gala, Thad Williamson &amp; Adria Scharf also at RPS Shines, Speaking with community members in Richmond’s West End, At Enterprise Holding’s ribbon cutting for their new Richmond Airport location.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Legislation for the Upcoming Session</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The 2023 Legislative Session will begin Wednesday, January 11, 2023, and adjourn Saturday, February 25, 2023. If you have an idea for potential legislation or have priorities you would like to share with me, do not hesitate to contact me. I will need to submit requests for drafts for potential legislation by December 1. You can email me at delegate.carr@betsycarr.org or call my office at 804-698-1069. Reach out and we will schedule a time to meet, whether virtually or in-person, to discuss.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At this point, I plan to submit, among other things, a number of JLARC recommendations concerning affordable housing, that were outlined in previous JLARC reports. You can read these reports <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2021-affordable-housing-in-virginia.asp" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Changes to Richmond’s Zoning</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Richmond has been considering three zoning changes. They include short-term rentals, parking requirements and accessory dwelling units. The City of Richmond Department of Planning and Development Review is hosting three meeting times to draft recommendations for the proposed zoning changes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The first two meetings will happen virtually on Microsoft Teams. The first meeting will be December 6, 12 PM. The second meeting will be December 8, 6 PM.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The final meeting will take place December 13, 6 PM, at the Main Public Library (101 East Franklin Street).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can find out more about the meetings and the zoning changes <a href="https://www.rva.gov/planning-development-review/zoning-changes" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Speaking and Meeting with Virginia College Advising Corps and Virginia529 staff.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>RetirePath by Virginia529</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Virginia529’s newest savings program, RetirePath Virginia, will give eligible employers across the Commonwealth a simple way to help their employees save for the future, with no employer fees, no fiduciary responsibility, and minimal administrative requirements. Virginia businesses that don’t offer a workplace retirement plan may be eligible to participate in the RetirePath Virginia pilot starting in early 2023. Interested employers are invited to learn more and apply <a href="https://www.retirepathva.com/program-pilot" target="_blank">at this link</a> by December 9, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pilot participants will receive dedicated support and the chance to be featured in statewide promotional materials. The program is available to for-profit and non-profit Virginia businesses with 25 or more eligible employees, operating for more than two years, and not currently offering a workplace retirement savings option. RetirePath Virginia is scheduled to start by July 1, 2023, with phased registration for eligible Virginia employers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The James River Park System Grows</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The James River Park System has grown by 3.46 acres, technically. A portion of the Buttermilk Trail ran through private property, and there were concerns that these portions would have to be closed if an easement was not agreed to.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now an easement is no longer required for a portion of the trail as Josh &amp; Carrie Belt Rogers chose to subdivide their lot and donate a 3.46 acre lot that contains the trail network to the Capitol Region Land Conservancy, ensuring the trail will remain open for generations to come.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Clockwise from top left: Touring Seibert’s Towing, Visiting Northside YMCA with Abigail Farris Rogers (Richmond YMCA’s President and CEO) and Delegate Lamont Bagby, With Emily &amp; Sam Altman at Richmond Public Library’s Centennial Celebration, with Peter Blake (Director of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia &amp; Richmond Public Library Foundation Board Member) and Scott Firestine (Director of Richmond Public Libraries) also at RPL’s Centennial event.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Richmond City Real Estate Tax Relief</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On Monday, Richmond City Council voted to keep real estate tax stable amid the rising assessment values that have concerned many in the city. Additionally, the City reaffirmed support for additional programs to combat displacement caused by growth. One such measure is a bill I introduced last Session, and will again this coming Session. It is a Long-Time Owner Occupant Program (LOOP) to offer tax relief to those who have been in their house for a substantial amount of time, but do not yet qualify for the senior citizen tax relief. These homeowners are often stalwarts in their communities and should be supported.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Affordable housing is a priority of mine and I am pleased to use my position to help tackle this crucial issue.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>GRASP Speakers</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">GRASP (GReat Aspirations Scholarship Program) has launched a Speakers Bureau to provide experienced GRASP counselors to speak at schools. GRASP’s presentations include topics such as a FAFSA walkthrough, admissions in a test-optional world and many others.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To schedule a GRASP counselor, email advising@grasp4va.org.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Lead Service Line Replacement</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The City is providing assistance with replacing lead service lines in older homes. <a href="https://rva.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/DPU%202022%20LSLR%20Program%20Presentation%20v.%206%208-18-2022.pdf" target="_blank">View this presentation</a> for more information.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>At the Jewish Community Federation of Richmond’s “Grand Event” with Peggy &amp; Dan Siegel and Inge Horowitz; John Mitchell, Ida Mitchell and Susan &amp; Pete Boisseau at a community event, Meeting with Damian Pitts of VCU’s Institute for Sustainable Energy &amp; Environment (ISEE), Meeting with Cynthia Brittain, Marshall Terry and Dylan Bishop of the Virginia Governmental Employees Association.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Leaf Collection Program</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Autumn advances, the leaves accumulate. The City has implemented several leaf collection options. Early and thorough leaf removal prevents risk of flooding and supports our City’s irrigation system.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Through the program, residents can have up to 10 bags picked up on their trash collection days. There will also be periods where residents are not limited to how many bags they can leave out for collection. These dates vary based on each neighborhood.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The City can also assist in “DIY” leaf removal options. You can order bins for mulching and composting, or take your leaves to one of three collection sites.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Finally, the City also provides a leaf vacuuming service, for a fee. For more information on each of these services, visit <a href="https://www.rva.gov/public-works/leaf-collection" target="_blank">the City’s website.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Dominion Bill Assistance</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Colder temperatures and high fuel costs are sure to lead to some very high bills this winter. Dominion offers several bill assistance programs. Their bill assistance is available to customers despite income level. Seniors, veterans, and those with a disability may qualify for additional assistance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Visit <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/billing/energy-assistance" target="_blank">this link</a> to not only learn about Dominion’s bill assistance program, but also for other resources like how to identify a utility scam.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Operation Catalytic Converter Crackdown</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Authorities in Central Virginia are teaming up with local partners to try and prevent catalytic converter thefts, which have been on the rise. You can have your catalytic converter painted for free at participating locations.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Visit <a href="https://converter.midasofrichmond.com/" target="_blank">this website</a> for more information.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Clockwise from top left: Presenting a commending resolution to Peggy Singlemann (outgoing Director of Park Operations &amp; Horticulture of Maymont) with Parke Richeson (Executive Director of Maymont), Touring Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden with Matthew Bruning (board member), Brian Trader (President/CEO) and Alice Baker (Chief Advancement Officer), Museum District Association’s (MDA) Annual Meeting with Susan Fourness, Karen Lebo, Katherine Hartwell and Boz Boschen; Janine Doyle (Incoming MDA President) and Alison Schutzer (MDA City Liaison).</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>City Composting Program</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thanks to a $90,000 grant from the USDA, Richmond is piloting a city-wide composting program. You can learn more about the program<a href="https://www.richmondgrowsgardens.org/composting" target="_blank"> here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>COVID &amp; Flu Updates</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we enter the Fall and Winter seasons, you may want to take precautions against influenza and COVID. Vaccines are safe and effective measures, and are available at most pharmacies in our community. The bivalent vaccine for COVID is also available in Virginia and offers protection against the Omicron variant. The <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/" target="_blank">Virginia Department of Health’s website</a> has information on this new vaccine.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To note, Richmond’s community transmission is currently low, but make sure to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html" target="_blank">check other localities</a> if you’re traveling.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Community Events</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Giving Heart’s 18th Annual Thanksgiving Feast </strong>will be held from 11 AM - 2 PM on Thanksgiving day at the Richmond Convention Center.

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">October is coming to a close and Election Day is around the corner. Happy belated Diwali to those who observe. The pace of events and activities is picking up in preparation for both the Holiday and pre-legislation seasons. I hope you and your loved ones are enjoying the colors and changes of Fall.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Election Day</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you have not participated in early voting yet, you have until Saturday, November 5, to do so. Registration to vote in this year’s election has closed. If you don’t plan to vote by November 5, make sure you cast your ballot on November 8, election day.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Participating in elections is essential to ensuring our system of governance is fair, representative and productive. On this year’s ballot, Virginians will vote for their representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. You can see whose district you are currently in, and which of the new districts you will be voting in for this coming election at <a href="https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/index.php/legislator?search=#" target="_blank">this website.</a> Note that these are the first elections being held in the newly redrawn districts. On that same website, you can look into changes at the state level, which will be on the ballot for the June primary and November general elections in 2023.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Daylight Saving Time</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">November 6 at 2 AM, the previous period of Daylight Saving Time expires, meaning our clocks fall behind 1 hour. This will last until March 12, 2023.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is some confusion on whether or not the practice of switching clocks between Daylight Saving Time and Standard Time is over. This arises from the U.S. Senate’s passage of a bill to keep the U.S. in Daylight Saving Time year-round. Although this bill did pass the Senate, it has not been acted upon in the House of Representatives, which it must also pass before heading to President Biden’s desk. Therefore, we are still set to fall back on November 6 and spring ahead on March 12. Plan accordingly.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>JLARC Reports</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On Monday, October 17, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) met to present their research and recommendations on several important issues such as affordable housing, progressive tax structure, gaming and the feasibility of a Petersburg Casino.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can watch the entire presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdbYFSWD-hs&amp;t=3422s" target="_blank">on Youtube here</a>. You can read <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/reports.asp" target="_blank">JLARC’s reports here</a>.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Appropriations Tour of Hampton Roads Region</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee (the committee that decides how taxpayer dollars will be spent), for a tour of the Hampton Roads Region. This tour affirmed my appreciation of some of our Commonwealth’s proud academic institutions, engines of commerce, and invaluable pieces of living history.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I throughly enjoyed seeing Fort Monroe, which is not only a National Historic Landmark but also the largest stone fort ever built in the United States, site of the future 1619 African Landing Memorial and host to a rich and diverse history. We also spent time admiring the natural beauty and facilities and accommodations of First Landing State Park, one of 41 state parks in Virginia.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We enjoyed a fascinating tour of the Virginia International Terminals and the Port of Virginia, which was recently recognized as a top-performing port in North America by The World Bank. We also visited another vital contributor to our Commonwealth, Newport News Shipbuilding, which is the sole producer of aircraft carriers and one of two producers of nuclear-powered submarines in the United States. Newport News Shipbuilding also has an abundance of <a href="https://careers.huntingtoningalls.com/" target="_blank">exciting career opportunities.</a> These destinations were exemplars in scale and technological primacy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, our tour included Old Dominion University and Norfolk State University, an HBCU with 68% of its population receiving Pell Grants. Old Dominion University’s <a href="https://oduadaptationandresilience.org/about-us/" target="_blank">Institute for Coastal Adaption and Resilience</a> has been a potent collaborator in promoting and advancing coastal resiliency efforts and innovation, both by leading projects and partnering with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. These two universities are excellently preparing our Commonwealth’s students for the future.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Richmond Civilian Review Board</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Richmond City Council passed an ordinance to establish a Civilian Review Board. The City is now proceeding with its recruitment process to fill the positions on the board. You can read more about the process through <a href="https://richmondvacitycouncil.blogspot.com/2022/10/richmond-city-councils-next-steps.html" target="_blank">this press release</a>.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Urban Canopy Improvement Opportunities</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As was laid bare in the <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/richmonds-urban-heat-islands----scotts-addition-jackson-ward-manchester---/article_9b712c7f-5395-512c-a485-9a4ba92a292e.html" target="_blank">study of Richmond’s heat islands</a>, our urban canopy is vital. In addition to reducing average temperatures in their direct surroundings, our trees also manage runoff, prevent erosion and provide filtration. VCU offers a community forestry program that connects their Facilities Management office with neighborhood organizations to lead projects that will support the Urban Canopy. Visit <a href="https://sustainability.vcu.edu/programs/community-forestry/" target="_blank">their website</a> to learn more.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, the <a href="https://thejamesriver.org/" target="_blank">James River Association</a> is involved in many projects that not only support our urban canopy, but strengthen the James River ecosystem as a whole. They are currently looking for volunteers to help out with tree-planting projects at three Richmond Public Library locations. Plantings will be held between November 2-4. Visit <a href="https://form.jotform.com/222824553655965" target="_blank">this website </a>for more information and to sign-up.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Lead Service Line Replacement</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The City is providing assistance with replacing lead service lines in older homes. <a href="https://rva.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/DPU%202022%20LSLR%20Program%20Presentation%20v.%206%208-18-2022.pdf" target="_blank">View this presentation</a> for more information.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Broadband Updates</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) has launched their Virginia Technology Initiative Project Dashboard. <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/virginiadhcd/viz/VATIDashboard/Overall" target="_blank">This website</a> provides an overview of broadband development projects.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">An additional resource of interest is the Federal Communication Commission’s “Affordable Connectivity Program.” This program provides significant discounts to internet service bills and can even provide discounted laptops and tablets for low-income households. Visit <a href="https://www.affordableconnectivity.gov/" target="_blank">the program’s website</a> for more information.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Leaf Collection Program</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Autumn advances, the leaves accumulate. The City has implemented several leaf collection options. Early and thorough leaf removal prevents risk of flooding and supports our City’s irrigation system.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Beginning November 7, residents can have up to 10 bags picked up on their trash collection days. There will also be periods where residents are not limited to how many bags they can leave out for collection. These dates vary based on each neighborhood.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The City can also assist in “DIY” leaf removal options. You can order bins for mulching and composting, or take your leaves to one of three collection sites.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Finally, the City also provides a leaf vacuuming service, for a fee. For more information on each of these services, visit <a href="https://www.rva.gov/public-works/leaf-collection" target="_blank">the City’s website.</a></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>City Composting Program</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thanks to a $90,000 grant from the USDA, Richmond is piloting a city-wide composting program. You can learn more about the program <a href="https://www.richmondgrowsgardens.org/composting" target="_blank">here.</a></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>COVID &amp; Flu Updates</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As we enter the Fall and Winter seasons, you may want to take precautions against influenza and COVID. Vaccines are safe and effective measures, and are available at most pharmacies in our community. The bivalent vaccine for COVID is also available in Virginia and offers protection against the Omicron variant. The <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/" target="_blank">Virginia Department of Health’s website</a> has information on this new vaccine.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To note, Richmond’s community transmission is currently low, but make sure to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html" target="_blank">check other localities</a> if you’re traveling.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Operation Catalytic Converter Crackdown</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Authorities in Central Virginia are teaming up with local partners to try and prevent catalytic converter thefts, which have been on the rise. You can have your catalytic converter painted for free at <a href="https://converter.midasofrichmond.com/" target="_blank">participating locations.</a></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Community Events</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Virginia Holocaust Museum </strong>is partnering with Virginia Public Media (VPM) to provide a <a href="https://www.vaholocaust.org/?event=the-u-s-and-the-holocaust-film-screening-and-panel-discussion" target="_blank">screening and panel discussion</a> of Ken Burns’ docuseries “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/us-and-the-holocaust/?utm_source=Email+SignUp&amp;utm_campaign=9fcc3cac95-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_11_26_08_11_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_241da40009-9fcc3cac95-80910605" target="_blank">The U.S. and the Holocaust</a>.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Virginia Museum of History &amp; Culture </strong>will be hosting family-friendly first Fridays starting November 4. They will offer extended hours of 5 - 8 PM, live entertainment, food trucks, and discounted beer and wine.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Happy belated Rosh Hashanah to those who observe. I hope the new year brings you good health and good fortune. Meanwhile, there is much to be considered, viewed and experienced in our Richmond region and around the Commonwealth. Updates on Hurricane Ian, Special Session, special city projects, and more follow.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Hurricane Ian</strong></h3><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My thoughts are with the communities who sustained heavy damage in Florida as well as those in the Carolinas. In Virginia, the Governor declared a state of emergency, allowing all state agencies to be prepared to help if needed.</h3><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Special Session</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The General Assembly reconvened on September 7 to discuss an appointment to the vacancy at the State Corporation Commission. An agreement was not reached and the vacancy is expected to be left open until this coming 2023 Session.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Governor Youngkin’s Education Policy</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two weeks ago, Governor Youngkin and the Virginia Department of Education released new model policies for school districts to adopt. This model policy rolls back much of the protection and privacy for transgender students that was adopted in 2020 legislation. The <a href="https://doe.virginia.gov/support/gender-diversity/transgender-student-model-policies.docx" target="_blank">model policies</a> that came from 2020 legislation resulted from the thorough and rigorous work of a group who sought the input of parents and stakeholders.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In contrast, the Administration chose to move unilaterally on this subject. This is an affront to the voices of the parents, teachers, and stakeholders who need to be heard. I am steadfast in my belief that all students need to associate school with a safe, productive learning environment. Our trans students are no exception. The Administration’s policies need to undergo a period of public comment before they take effect. To make your voice heard, follow <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?GDocForumID=1953" target="_blank">this link</a>. Public comment will close on October 26.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Early Voting Begins</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Early, in-person voting is open. You can visit the registrar’s office or a satellite voting location to cast your ballot. Make sure you present a valid ID (see the link below for acceptable forms of ID). Early voting will continue until November 5 and you have until October 17 to register to vote. Election day will be on November 8.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Richmonders can expect a new ballot-on-demand system when they show up to vote early. Richmond needs to produce 77 different ballots, as the city has 77 precincts. This system will ensure that voters are receiving the correct ballot and that their votes are being accurately cast. When you go to vote, the system will print a ballot, you then enter the ballot and make your selection digitally. Once this is done, the system will print the ballot for you to place in the ballot box.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Visit the <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/early-absentee/" target="_blank">Department of Elections’s website</a> for information on early voting, redistricting, early voting locations, and important dates.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Diamond District Update</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The City has selected a development team to execute the Diamond District development project. RVA Diamond Partners was selected based on their proposal to convert 67.5 acres of under-developed, publicly owned land into a mixed-income, multi-use district. Highlights include an increase in the City’s housing stock, a new baseball stadium, parks, and plans to reintroduce the extra-curricular and recreational programs that had been provided in the Arthur Ashe Community Center.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Visit the <a href="https://www.rva.gov/economic-development/diamond" target="_blank">City’s website</a> for the most up-to-date information on the Diamond District.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Fall Line Trail Update</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Earlier this month, I had the pleasure of joining with Northside community members to learn more about the <a href="https://www.falllineva.org/" target="_blank">Fall Line Trail </a>plans. This trail will connect Ashland, Richmond and Petersburg with a 43 mile long trail. It was inspiring to see the level of civic engagement that evening. The City’s office of Equitable Transit &amp; Mobility is relying on feedback from residents to ensure the final product works for everyone.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can learn more about the Richmond segment of the trail and submit comments on the <a href="https://rva.gov/index.php/public-works/fall-line-trail" target="_blank">City’s website</a>. In addition, your neighborhood’s civic association can invite City officials to its meeting to increase awareness, ask questions directly, and voice concerns. The City’s team can be reached at connects@rva.gov or by phone at 804-646-3533.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Job Opportunities</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Below are listed some employment opportunities that have recently been shared with me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Virginia Employment Commission is hosting a statewide, virtual job fair on October 5, 10 AM - 2 PM. Employers and Job-seekers can learn more and register <a href="https://app.premiervirtual.com/events/683f21c9-6a48-48dc-8036-c23ac8cd272a" target="_blank">at this link.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 666 shared their apprenticeship and electrician job boards with me. If you have less than 4 years experience, visit the <a href="https://www.rjatc.org/" target="_blank">Richmond Joint Apprenticeship Committee’s website</a> to learn about some of their opportunities and to apply. If you have 4 or more years, visit the IBEW 666’s application portal <a href="http://www.ibewlocal666.com/index.cfm?zone=/unionactive/form_page.cfm&amp;formID=106126" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Richmond is seeking recruits for the Fire Department. You can learn about the position and apply <a href="https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/richmond?keywords=%22fire%20recruit%22&amp;pagetype=jobOpportunitiesJobs&amp;jobId=3611848&amp;jobName=fire-recruit&amp;tab=1" target="_blank">at this website</a>. Potential recruits can email firecareers@rva.gov or call 804-646-2500 to learn more.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>FAFSA Application Assistance</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Great Aspirations Scholarship Program (GRASP) is offering students and families assistance with completing their FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Follow <a href="https://grasp4va.org/grasp-schools" target="_blank">this link</a> to find your student’s school to set an appointment with the GRASP counselor assigned to that school.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Grant Opportunities</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Virginia Museum of History &amp; Culture’s Commonwealth History Fund is accepting grant applications until October 31. The grants are given to meaningful historical education and preservation projects. You can learn more about the grant and apply <a href="https://virginiahistory.org/commonwealth-history-fund?utm_source=wordfly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=9.16.22-CommonwealthHistoryFundOpeningOct1forApplications&amp;utm_content=version_A&amp;promo=2658" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The City provides grants to homeowners looking to replace lead water service lines. You can read more about the program, certified plumbers, and how to apply at this <a href="https://www.rva.gov/public-utilities/lead-service-line-replacement-grant-program" target="_blank">website.</a></p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>State Tax Rebate</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you paid and filed state income taxes for the 2021 year you are eligible for a tax rebate. The State is issuing rebates in the order that taxpayers filed; the earlier you filed, the earlier your rebate will arrive. You do not need to do anything to initiate the rebate. Everyone should receive their rebates by November 1. Your rebate will arrive the same way you paid taxes, so many people will receive their rebate via direct deposit. If you sent a check, your rebate will come via mail. Individuals will receive $250 and couples will receive $500.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can learn more and check eligibility at <a href="https://www.tax.virginia.gov/rebate" target="_blank">this website</a>.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>City Composting Program</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thanks to a $90,000 grant from the USDA, Richmond will now pilot a city compost program.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Summer is beginning to wind down and school has begun. I hope you and your loved ones have had an enjoyable summer to be topped off with Labor Day observances and are looking forward to the change in climate and scenery as we welcome fall. The General Assembly is set to reconvene for a brief session on Wednesday, September 7th.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>First Day of School</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Richmond Public Schools kicked off the 2022-2023 school year on August 29th. Make sure your children are up to date on their immunizations and are set with the supplies they need to succeed. You can find all the information you need for back-to-school at <a href="http://www.rvaschools.net/students-families/back-to-school"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this site</span></a> and read RPS’s most recent <a href="https://www.rvaschools.net/about/health-safety-20#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20tests%20are%20available,)%3B%20individuals%20should%20monitor%20symptoms"><span style="text-decoration:underline">COVID mitigation protocols here.</span></a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For all teachers and professors, Rostov’s Coffee &amp; Tea is having a 10% off discount until October 15th as long as a valid school ID is shown at the register.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Monkeypox</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Richmond and Henrico Health District (RHHD) has recently expanded eligibility for the monkeypox vaccine. You can fill out a vaccine interest form at: <a href="https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=3FPA3WNRKX"><span style="text-decoration:underline">https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=3FPA3WNRKX</span></a> , but beware that the RHHD is working to get vaccines to those most at risk first. You can find more information about symptoms, testing, FAQs, and vaccination at <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/richmond-city/monkeypox"><span style="text-decoration:underline">https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/richmond-city/monkeypox</span></a>.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Inflation Reduction Act</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act and it was signed into law on August 16, 2022. This important piece of federal legislation contains a suite of provisions to curtail the rising cost of living. It targets drug and healthcare costs; supports clean economy initiatives like electric vehicles and renewable energy sources; and many other things.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you like to learn more about the Inflation Reduction Act, visit <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/19/fact-sheet-the-inflation-reduction-act-supports-workers-and-families/" target="_blank">this website</a>.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Student Debt Cancellation</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The White House and the US Department of Education recently announced a three phase student debt relief plan. This plan extends the federal debt repayment pause through the end of the year. Payments on federal student debt will not resume until January 2023. Additionally, the plan offers debt forgiveness of up to $20,000 dollars to Pell grant recipients and $10,000 for borrowers who did not receive a Pell grant. To qualify, borrowers must have an income below $125,000 or $250,000 for households. The plan also has measures to make repayment systems more manageable moving forward.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, if you have worked in public service for 10 or more years, you may be eligible to have all of your debt forgiven. This is through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (PSLF). If you think this applies to you, please visit <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/publicserviceloanforgiveness/?utm_source=pslf.gov"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this site</span></a>, as applications close October 31st, 2022.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you want more information on the changes to student debt forgiveness, visit <a href="https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement/"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this site</span></a>. You may also want to <a href="https://www.ed.gov/subscriptions"><span style="text-decoration:underline">subscribe to emails</span></a> from the Department of Education to be alerted when the application portal for debt forgiveness opens.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am committed to making sure higher education is affordable in Virginia. That is why I sponsored a study in the state budge to analyze student debt holdings and find ways to address the challenges of student debt burden.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Expansion of Medical Amnesty</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was proud to carry and fight for a safe reporting law in 2015 that protected individuals from being prosecuted from reporting an overdose. A recent Appeals Court ruling expanded the interpretation of this law in two important ways. First it expanded the law to apply to not only overdoses, but '“life-threatening conditions,” such as suicidal thoughts. Second, it ensured that one does not need proof that they are having an overdose to safely report.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is an important step in making sure those suffering from drug abuse and addiction receive the proper help, both to stabilize them short-term and help them rehabilitate in the long term. I was proud to carry this harm reduction bill in 2015 and I look forward to continuing work in this area in the future.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virginia Housing’s “Power of Home” Art Contest</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2022 marks the 50th anniversary of Virginia Housing’s founding. To help celebrate their anniversary and all the tremendous work they’ve done, Virginia Housing created an art contest called the “Power of Home.” Participants will create one piece of original art that represents what the “Power of Home” means to them.

There are now three zoning ordinances to be considered. The first is regarding short-term rentals like AirBnbs. The second ordinance is to eliminate parking minimums.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m sure you’ve heard the news: The Supreme Court of the United States overturned Roe v. Wade this morning. What does this mean? It means that states can decide what, if any, restrictions they want to place on abortion. Unfortunately, it means that abortion can be banned too.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am outraged, sad, and beyond disappointed that our highest court in the land made such an impactful decision that will harm the lives of many women and their families. The truth is that allowing states to ban abortions doesn’t stop abortions. It bans <em>safe </em>abortions.</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Women deserve to make their own reproductive health care decisions that are right for them. Important healthcare decisions, like abortion, should be between a woman and her doctor. Thankfully, despite recent unsuccessful attempts to roll back abortion protections in Virginia, Virginians can still legally access safe abortions. I promise you that I will stand strong. I will work to protect the progress we’ve made in Virginia on abortion access. I will help Virginia to continue to move forward, not back.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is an honor to serve in the House of Delegates.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dear Friend,</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I hope you had an enjoyable weekend celebrating the fathers and father figures in your lives as well as honoring the Juneteenth holiday. Since my last update, the General Assembly convened to vote on the state budget for the next biennium on June 1. They met again last Friday, June 17, to vote on the Governor’s amendments to the budget. Below I will provide details on what is included in the budget as well as other important state and community updates.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>State Budget Update</strong></h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The General Assembly passes a new budget every two years (i.e. the biennium). This year, the budget did not pass during the regular session, which is why the General Assembly met for a special session this June ahead of the July 1 deadline.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To review the budget’s conference report and the Governor’s recommendations on the budget, visit <a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=aea19efce8&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">budget.lis.virginia.gov</a>. You can review legislative actions taken on <a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=69171ba33d&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">HB29</a> and <a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=50044eac97&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">HB30</a> (the budget bills) on <a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=341f5f6dc8&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">lis.virginia.gov</a>. The video recording of the House Appropriations Budget Briefing on June 1 is available <a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=1f3b79ae2a&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Additionally, I suggest reviewing the Commonwealth Institute’s side-by-side comparison of the House, Senate, and Conference budgets for a quick overview of the “big ticket” items in the budget.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=80d371d69f&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">TCI’s Budget Side-by-Side</a></p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>What’s in the budget?</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No budget is perfect, and even with the extra time, this budget certainly has its issues. With a Republican majority in the House and a narrow Democratic majority in the Senate, both sides fought hard for their values and compromises had to be made to complete the budget prior to July 1. The budget is certainly a bipartisan bill with wins and losses but ultimately a representation of the Commonwealth’s diverse population of varying needs and values.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I voted to support the budget even though I didn’t support every line. When voting on the conference report of the budget, you do not get to oppose individual items within it. Instead, you must vote either “yea” or “nay” on the whole budget.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thankfully, the Commonwealth has benefited from two terms of Democratic governors, leaving Virginia with a strong financial position, economy, and billions in federal funding from the pandemic.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Pay Raises for State Employees</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">State employees, including teachers, will get a 5% raise each year, a $1,000 bonus, and targeted pay increases for certain law enforcement, behavioral health staff, and correctional officers. The first increase will be effective August 1, 2022.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>K-12 Education</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The budget includes historic levels of funding for our public schools.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$1.25 billion in new funding for school construction and upgrades</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">10% teacher raises and $1,000 bonuses</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">New funding to hire more support staff, reading specialists, and ensuring a full-time principal in every school</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Tax Relief</strong></h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am glad that the budget provides real relief for Virginian families, particularly the refundable Earned Income Tax Credit, which has been a priority item for a long time and will be a new tool for targeted tax relief in the Commonwealth.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Standard deduction for individuals will increase from $4,500 to $8,000 and for couples it increases from $9,000 to $16,000</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One-time tax rebate of $250 for individuals and $500 for couples</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The grocery tax was not fully eliminated, but beginning in 2023, 1.5% (what comes from the state) will be eliminated. Localities will still be able to tax groceries at 1%. The state will offset the loss to local school systems using state revenues.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">15% of the earned income tax credit will be refundable for low-income families who do not pay enough taxes to offset the entire credit.</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Housing</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$40 million to the Virginia Housing Trust Fund, totaling $150 million in the next two years</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$250 million to the Virginia Housing Opportunity Tax Credit program over the next 10 years</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$190 million to fund an energy efficiency program</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is progress for affordable housing after being underfunded for so long. However, there is still more work to be done to help families and individuals with the raising costs of homeownership and renting.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Environment</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">More than $250 million for Water Quality Improvement Fund</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$25 million to DEQ Stormwater Local Assistance Fund</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$332.6 million of ARPA funds for Combined Sewer Overflow (CSOs), wastewater projects, community waterworks and other upgrades</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">More than $40 million in investments for Virginia’s trail system</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Delays the implementation of the ban on polystyrene food containers to 2028. I was very disappointed by this inclusion in the budget and strongly advocated to have this provision removed.</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Health Care</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$390 million to fund 600 additional Developmental Disability (DD) waiver slots in FY24 and increased reimbursement rate for additional DD waiver services</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">7.5% increase in Medicaid reimbursement for personal care services</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Higher Education</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$90 million to increase affordable access to HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities)</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$2 million to fund an innovation center at Virginia Union University</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$28.3 million increase in annual TAG (Tuition Grant Assistance) program; new maximum award will be $4,500 in FY23 and $5,000 in FY24 with award amount set at 50% for new online students</p></li></ul><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Criminal Justice</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$6 million to expand the Marcus Alert System to 5 additional localities</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A new criminal penalty for marijuana possession was included in the budget. Possession of more than 4 ounces could result in a Class 3 criminal misdemeanor, which is a fine of up to $500 on the first offense. This does not apply to marijuana grown inside your home. I do not support the re-criminalization of recreational cannabis use or think this is an appropriate step forward for this issue.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">$8 million to fund the Firearm Violence Intervention and Prevention Grant Fund; while this funding is a start, I supported the Senate’s original allotment of $22.4 million to this program.</p></li></ul><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>The Governor’s Budget Amendments</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After the General Assembly voted on the budget, the Governor had the opportunity to offer amendments, which the House and Senate voted on during the June 17 special session. The Governor made 38 amendments, most were non-controversial. Several amendments raised concerns related to limiting abortion access, rolling back Earned Sentence Credits, and creating a new felony for picketing. <a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=492a37e4bc&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">You can read a review here in the Virginia Mercury.</a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Amendments that were defeated:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Amendment 20:</strong> Related to Amendment 35; provides additional prison bed space for those who may be convicted of felonious picketing</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Amendment 30: </strong>Prohibits any budget funding from being used for abortion services</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Amendment 31:</strong> Restricts increases in gasoline and diesel fuel taxes to two percent annually and suspends state-wide taxes on wholesale distribution of gasoline and diesel fuel from July 1, 2022 through September 30, 2022.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Amendment 32: </strong>Creates a rebuttable presumption against bail for certain criminal offenses</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Amendment 35: </strong>Creates Class 6 felony for picketing or demonstrating relating to a court or residence of a judge, juror, witness, court officer, etc.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can review each of the <a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=607742c566&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">Governor’s amendments here</a> as well as <a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=6af24d3bbd&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">their outcome here</a>. The budget now goes back to the Governor to sign or veto.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Other Legislative Actions</strong></h1><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Bills in Conference</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are still several bills in “conference committee,” meaning that the details of the final legislation is still being debated amongst a small, selected group of House and Senate members. During the June 17 special session, in addition to voting on the Governor’s budget amendments, the General Assembly also voted on bills in conference:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=77ca30b705&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">HB90</a>/<a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=d39852a802&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">SB451</a>: Eliminates state sales tax on hygiene products, like tampons, beginning January 1, 2023</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=e32f6bb76e&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">SB47</a>: Removes the $15 million credit cap on the Virginia Housing Opportunity Tax Credit</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://betsycarr.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fa2bfcd205d55469e67353c32&amp;id=f339a23b47&amp;e=c0ebda3575" target="_blank">SB471</a>: Amends the Literary Fund so more funding is available to local school divisions</p></li></ul><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Filling Judicial Vacancies</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The General Assembly elected several judges to open positions:</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Supreme Court of Virginia (12 year term)</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thomas P.
