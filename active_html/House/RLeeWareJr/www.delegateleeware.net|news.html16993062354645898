<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center;"><font size="5">Nationally Eminent Journal Praises<br />Delegate Ware for 2023 Legislative Victory</font><br /><br /></div>

<div class="paragraph">Delegate Lee Ware is accorded high praise in a lead report in the June edition of <em>The Atlantic Monthly </em>for his long, lonely quest to restore oversight of utility rates to the State Corporation Commission (SCC).<br /><br />George Packer, author of the piece entitled, &ldquo;The Plutocrat vs. The Monopoly&rdquo; (the plutocrat is Michael Bills of Charlottesville, founder of Clean Virginia, and the monopoly is Dominion Energy), interviewed Delegate Ware in the legislator&rsquo;s office in Powhatan Court House.&nbsp; Del. Ware, a Republican, was patron of House Bill 1604 of the 2023 General Assembly; chief co-patron was Delegate Rip Sullivan, Democrat of Fairfax-Arlington.&nbsp; With the crucial support of Governor Glenn Youngkin, the bill&mdash;one in a series that Del. Ware has proposed for more than a decade&mdash;was passed unanimously by both chambers of the legislature.&nbsp; Its effect will be to dramatically lower&mdash;or at least to limit&mdash;the cost of electricity for ratepayers.<br /><br />&ldquo;Over the years, a few lonely legislators spoke up against Dominion [for having in 2007 gained passage of a bill to limit SCC oversight of its rates],&rdquo; Mr. Packer writes.&nbsp; &ldquo;One was Lee Ware, a white-haired Republican member of the House of Delegates in rural central Virginia.<br /><br />&ldquo;The walls of Delegate Ware&rsquo;s home library are lined with works of literature, philosophy, and theology, along with portraits of Confederate generals [editor&rsquo;s note: and with an historic memento of a distinguished Union colonel].&nbsp; When I visited, Ware was reading Jacques Barzun and the letters of Flannery O&rsquo;Connor; his political models are Edmund Burke and Cicero.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ware actually read Dominion&rsquo;s bills, and for years he was the only Republican to speak and vote against them consistently.&nbsp; &lsquo;It became evident to me,&rdquo; Del. Ware explained, &ldquo;that Dominion was putting their thumb on the scale on their own behalf,&rsquo; he said, in a way that must be called &lsquo;courtly.&rsquo; &lsquo;It just over time became evident that this was unseemly,&rsquo;&rdquo; Delegate Ware commented.<br /><br />Mr. Packer explains the history of Del. Ware&rsquo;s decade-long quest to restore oversight of utility-monopolies&rsquo; rate requests to the SCC, and again refers to Delegate Ware&rsquo;s instrumental success in the 2023 Assembly:<br /><br />&ldquo;Delegate Lee Ware, the longtime Republican&hellip;spoke of &lsquo;the sense that Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Insurance, big banks that are too big to fail&mdash;these behemoths are in control of our lives, and the ordinary citizen says, &lsquo;Who speaks for me?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br />As House Bill 1604 of 2023 demonstrates, the answer is&hellip;Delegate Lee Ware.<br /></div>

<div class="paragraph"><font size="4"><strong><em>Delegate Ware Calls for Civility in Political Discourse</em></strong></font><br /><br />Speech on the Floor of the Virginia House of Delegates<br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen of the House,<br /><br />We gather here today amid a great change in the constitution of this body.&nbsp; Nearly a quarter of the men and women who sat here on my side of the aisle just one year ago are gone--swept away at the polls by the sovereign voice of the people in their ballots on November 7.<br /><br />Such <em>change</em> has become a constant in our lives in a now- continental society given to turbo-capitalism and the continual revolution of science.&nbsp; Still, some realities are impervious to the emotions agitated by the media or the ideologies by which our political parties contend for the right to govern.&nbsp; Still our budget must be balanced.&nbsp; Still we have problems to address that defy simple remedy.&nbsp; Still we will have important issues to debate--and to decide.&nbsp; And, still we need to make our way to a discourse and decisions worthy of the complex Commonwealth we assemble today to serve.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Two generations ago--in 1955--Wm F. Buckley Jr. defined a Conservative as &ldquo;someone who stands athwart history, yelling <em>Stop</em>, at a time when no one is inclined to do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably all 100 of us here today can agree on one thing at least, which is that History did not stop, and much of the social and political order of our parents&rsquo; generation has been swept away- - largely by technologies and pharmaceuticals that may prove as destructive of human nature as they are alluring to human appetites.<br />&nbsp;<br />How can History be &lsquo;stopped&rsquo;--or even slowed when science dissolves even whole societies&rsquo; let alone the individual&rsquo;s ability to maintain traditional norms&mdash;or our fabled American sense of self-government, and independence of judgment?&nbsp; A litany of thinkers has attempted to answer those questions&mdash;among the most notable being Aldous Huxley, author of <em>Brave New World</em>; C.S. Lewis, author of <em>The Abolition of Man</em>; George Orwell, with whose <em>1984</em> or <em>Animal Farm</em> many of us will be familiar.&nbsp;<br /><br />My own litany of prophetic voices about the fragility of ordered liberty and the sundry threats to human dignity begins with Plato, who well warns that democracies invariably tend&mdash;and end&mdash;in tyranny.&nbsp; The Framers of our Constitution understood this, and so bequeathed us republican--<em>emphatically <u>small</u> r</em>&mdash;forms to channel democratic passions.<br />&nbsp;<br />More recently, Jacob Burckhardt forewarned in the 1890s that the challenges of modern cities and economies would tempt the masses to choose &ldquo;terrible simplifiers&rdquo; to impose a single, totalitarian remedy to the new problems of &ldquo;modern life&rdquo;&hellip;&nbsp;<br /><br />Ortega y Gasset in 1932 warned of &ldquo;the revolt of the masses&rdquo; against all forms of superior achievement; Tocqueville a century earlier wondered if we Americans, in our preoccupation with equality, would at last subvert liberty through a &ldquo;mass conformism&rdquo; that would instantiate a &ldquo;soft despotism&rdquo; every bit&mdash;and more&mdash;tyrannical than the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; dictatorships of armed ideologies.<br /><br />And Christopher Lasch, who in 1979 suggested that the social changes Tocqueville, Burckhardt, and others noticed in the 19th Century led to &ldquo;an historical period characterized by&hellip; [an increasing number of individuals] in a state of marked narcissism with all its pathological symptoms.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />The reference is to <em>our</em> period&hellip;to <strong><em>us</em></strong>.<br /><br />It will come as no surprise to this audience that I define myself as a Conservative.&nbsp; But what, I constantly ask myself, can the Conservative hope to <em>conserve</em>--to <em>do</em>--when Constant Change is the dynamic engine of society, economy, and polity?<br /><br />My answer is, the Conservative can bear witness to truths that have been tested by time and transmitted by tradition.&nbsp; For example, no matter how high the federal debt becomes, one and one still equals two, and no people can thrive who spend beyond their means.&nbsp; The day may come when voters break entirely with such truths, but still one can bear witness.<br /><br />This approach is what Edmund Burke described as &ldquo;the cake of custom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Custom can be broken, or abandoned, but even then, there remains one creed--one fragment of custom, as it were--that is impervious and equal to all change.&nbsp; That custom is <em>charity</em>.<br /><br />Indulge a veteran of two decades in these chambers to invite all of us, amid the &ldquo;sound and fury&rdquo; that will invariably occur in coming weeks, to remember that, in the end, Shakespeare found it all to signify only &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Nothing</em>,&rdquo; that is, compared to the principles and the experiences that endure.&nbsp;<br /><br />As an example of this, the oldest of all the traditions extolled by the Conservative, I deeply regret that we will not any longer be practicing one of the most ancient of all customs of the House of Delegates.&nbsp; Of course, I bow to the decision of our constituted authority, but in doing so I am compelled to bear witness to what I believe is the Conservative&rsquo;s obligatory response to the &ldquo;Brave New World&rdquo; upon which we are entered.<br /><br />And so, to Delegate Ken Plum of the 36th District I say, Sir, no matter how now I must address you in this chamber, and though we will continue to vote differently on a wide array of issues, you will remain for me <em>The Gentleman</em> from Fairfax.&nbsp; The same is true for everyone in every seat in this body, for each of you has been elected to represent the constituents of your district <em>on</em> <em>the terms by which you campaigned for their votes</em>.&nbsp; Congratulations, and Welcome.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />May we differ, but never demean; may we listen as well as clamor; and may many of us emerge in mid-March&mdash;as Aristotle would have us do&mdash;in a kind of friendship that transcends solely partisan obligations and opens us to the cooperation required for us to serve together our <em>common weal</em>.<br /></div>

<div class="paragraph"><font size="5" color="#00a">Delegate Ware speaks on Burdensome Mandates Affecting Teachers</font><br /><strong>Floor Remarks in The Virginia House of Delegates<br />By Delegate Lee Ware March 9, 2016 </strong><br /><br />Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the House. I rise to speak of a matter that properly commands our attention and devotion -- that is, public education. We expend 30 percent of General Fund tax dollars on public schooling, more than any other single item; an entire Article of the Virginia Constitution Article is devoted public education.<br /><br />Many of us bring bills annually regarding our schools. What I want you to think about as you prepare education bills during coming months are the harried administrators and the teachers who already are swamped with their daily tasks and who would be directly&mdash;and adversely&mdash;affected by any new laws we add to the Code of Virginia.<br /><br />A year ago, Senator Janet Howell and I co-patroned legislation leading to a review of the reasons for teacher turnover. We need to determine why so many outstanding teachers leave the profession. Those reasons are many, from becoming jaded to those for whom the job is just not a good fit.<br /><br />As you head into the off-season, I ask you to consider those people who work with our students every day. Ask yourself if they don't think about class sizes, student obesity, specific facts to be included in classes, the array of matters that enter into daily life in our schools.<br /><br />I ask you to remember the teacher who this afternoon will head to the store and out of her modest salary buy students supplies to supplement the meager the resources of her classroom. I ask you to reflect on that teacher who teaches all day, then corrects papers, answers e-mail, and turns to freshening his lesson plans, weighing how he can engage that withdrawn student, reach the other student who seems unreachable.<br /><br />When you contemplate the next great idea, or even good idea, that would add to the duties of our teachers and other professionals in public education, I ask you to recall the words of Oliver Cromwell (overlooking the quaint phraseology, but heeding the lesson): "I beseech you in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken."<br /><br />I ask you to visit your schools. Inquire of teachers and principals; if your schedule allows, volunteer there.<br /><br />I ask you to think of legislation akin to that championed by the Gentleman from Loudoun, Mr. Greason, to eliminate judiciously certain SOL tests, or the Gentlelady from Chesterfield, Delegate Robinson, to restore control of the school calendar to schools (what a novel idea), or the Gentleman from Augusta, Mr. Landes who has had an ongoing and annual project of reducing the size of the Code of Virginia.<br /><br />Moreover, think of those exemplary teachers, administrators and superintendents (but don't look too closely at the fine ones who serve the counties of the 65th District) that you know. I implore you: don't further encumber them, assist them; don't needlessly regulate their work, enhance it.<br /><br />I know that every one of you wants to fortify and ennoble those places we call <em>schools</em>. Remember that the root word of 'school' is <em>schola</em>&mdash;meaning leisure. Learning occurs only when teachers and students have the leisure, uninterrupted by new regulations from Richmond, to do so. I urge you to consider with care the practical effect of education legislation you consider.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="paragraph"><font size="5" color="#00a">Delegate Ware speaks on "Black History Month"</font><br /><strong>Black History Month</strong><br />Floor Remarks in The Virginia House of Delegates<br />By Delegate Lee Ware February 6, 2014<br /><br />As an historian, and also as the delegate for a large constituency of black citizens, with many of whom I have enjoyed long years of warm friendship, I accepted at once the invitation extended by a Member "from across the aisle" to offer some reflections on Black History Month.<br /><br />It is fitting that we set aside time each year to recognize and to affirm the achievements of Virginians--and Americans--who happen to be black. After all, there was a time when the experiences and the accomplishments of blacks were assigned a subordinate place in the narrative of American history. So today, permit me to offer a word of congratulations especially to our fellow members who as blacks rightly take an especial pride in serving as Members of the oldest continuous legislative body in the Western world.<br /><br />I extend these congratulations also, of course, to all Virginians who are black--and with them to all Virginians, without regard to racial considerations.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />In his immemorial summons to the American people, Martin Luther King, Jr. defined a dream that of course included full participation in the political and economic life of the nation for all Americans, but let us today pay particular attention to his precise words:<br /><br />"I have a dream," Dr. King declared, "that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."<br /><br />Owing in no small part to the lives and labors of the black men and women in this room today&mdash;and to their pioneering predecessors--our Commonwealth, and our nation, have advanced a long way toward the realization of that dream.<br /><br />Race remains important--of course. Yet it is now by no means the primary determinant in our lives, socially, economically, or politically. Much has been accomplished by Virginians in the half-century since the great civil-rights milestones of the 1960s. Yet much remains to be achieved.<br /><br />One of my own dreams, for example, is that there will come a day when a majority of the honorable delegates among us today who happen to be black are members of my own political party. When that day comes--when race is not at all a factor in the minds of any of our voters--then, then we will have erased yet another hyphen in the self-definition of the Virginian&mdash;and of the American, people.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />There would have been no America that we can imagine, and surely there could have been no Southern culture worthy of the name, without our black brethren. I say brethren, because it is indisputable that religion, and specifically Christian faith, is inseparable from the experience of black Virginians, and that an undying devotion to the faith of the Christian, and a courageous appeal to the obligations of Christian love, are among the principal contributions of blacks to Southern life.<br /><br />Recently two celebrations have occurred in my own community of Powhatan that wonderfully illustrate this point. One celebration was of the ongoing restoration of Belmead Plantation. The other was the annual Martin Luther King Youth Day Community Breakfast.<br /><br />Belmead was the plantation home of Philip St. George Cocke, the son of one of Thomas Jefferson's closest friends and a general in the Army of the Confederate States. After the War, Belmead was purchased by Katharine Drexel, daughter of a wealthy Northern industrialist. She had converted to the Roman Catholic communion--my own communion--and in time became one of the first American women to be canonized by the Church as a saint. And with the wealth from her family, and with the faithful labors of The Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, the religious order she founded, Belmead--home once to a slave owner--became, for many decades, a school for the education of the children, and the grandchildren, of former slaves.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />MLK Youth Day was hosted by Little Zion Baptist Church--a &ldquo;black church&rdquo;--and was held in the building of Powhatan United Methodist Church, a "white" church. Over 200 men, women, and children, black and white--and Indian, too--came together to remember Dr. King's original dream and to enjoy the fellowship of a dream that has largely become a living reality of our community.<br /><br />As I will state in a Resolution about the event, <em>In every tradition that manifests a revelation of the eternal there is a summons to accord equal respect to all individuals within the hierarchical communion that is crowned by the Divine, and without regard to the ephemeral considerations that often enough prevail in social, political, or economic matters; and</em><br /><br /><em>"&hellip;within the Graeco-Roman and Christian traditions from which the American order derives, the highest expression of the bond of fellowship finds expression in the declaration that, &ldquo;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.""</em><br /><br />This is the belief&mdash;and it is emphatically a religious belief--that was central to the summons proffered to the American people by Martin Luther King, Jr. And it this appeal, broadened of course to embrace men and women without regard not only to race but to religion, that is the justification for the observance of Black History Month.<br /><br />One day, I hope, there will be no need for a "black history month." That day will come when we will have achieved Dr. King's dream&mdash;when we will have crafted the national narrative that so effectively embraces all of us that no consideration whatsoever will be given to color, and none to "race"--except the human race.<br /></div>

<div class="paragraph"><font size="5" color="#00a">The Civil War Trust</font><br /><strong>Morning Hour remarks to the House of Delegates </strong><br />By Delegate Lee Ware, January 2014<br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen of the House, Exactly 150 years ago today armies of hundreds of thousands of men were huddled in their winter quarters. Most were exposed to the elements, and most camps were merely extensions of battlefields. Two nations were fighting to the death for principles in a catastrophic collision.<br /><br />Today, whichever side each of us may adjudge to have been in the right, probably all of us recognize the sacredness of the farm fields and woodlands, the rivers and seas, on which the American Iliad&mdash;the War Between the States&mdash;was fought.<br /><br />Richmond of course was then the capital of one of the contending countries. And, Virginia was the site of fully 123 of the 383 significant battles fought during the four cataclysmic years of 1861-1865. Forty-one of our counties and seven of our cities contain sites of major battlefields of the War.<br /><br />In 2006, anticipating the sesquicentennial of the War, the General Assembly established the &ldquo;Virginia Civil War Sites Preservation Fund.&rdquo; To date, over $12 million in grants have been awarded by this fund to preserve 6,500 acres of hallowed ground. Just last year, through our splendid Department of Historic Resources, $2.2 million was spent to save 1,263 acres of Virginian battlegrounds.<br /><br />Leading the way in the preservation of these lands is the Civil War Trust. Organized in 1987, the Trust in the 27 years since has&mdash;through private donations coupled with grants from the several States&mdash;preserved 20,504 acres of battlefields in Virginia alone.<br /><br />All told, The Civil War trust has saved for posterity a total of 38,552 acres in 20 states. Since 1999 the Trust has saved more than four times as much land as has The National Park Service. (As an aside, please permit me to quip that, since it was the national government that turned our private lands into battlefields in the first place it will not surprise Virginians that private hands, and private treasure have led the way in preserving these sacred sites for future generations.)<br /><br />Today, we are privileged to have with us, in the Gallery, the president of the Civil War Trust, Jim Lighthizer. This evening, we all are invited to a reception and dinner being hosted by the Trust across the street at the Library of Virginia.<br /><br />Join me, then, please, in welcoming Jim Lighthizer to the House of Delegates, and let our round of applause testify to our abiding admiration for his indomitable labors in behalf of the places made holy by the lives&mdash;and too often the deaths&mdash;of our forebears.<br /></div>

<div class="paragraph"><font size="5" color="#00a">Guidance for Elementary School Graduates</font><br /><strong>A Father's Creed for a Full Life </strong><br />Remarks to Goochland Elementary School Graduates 2014<br /><br />It is a pleasure to be back with you at Goochland Elementary School for this landmark day for the 5th grade class. Your graduation today brings you to the next stage, the next chapter of your lives. Earlier this year, I had the chance to observe many of you and your teachers at work. Seeing the learning atmosphere and accomplishment made it a rewarding morning for me.<br /><br />This morning I want to take you back 90 years to the graduation at a three-room grade school in tiny Centerton, in central Indiana on a day very like today. A boy named John, who&rsquo;d grown up on a farm nearby &ndash; a farm with no electricity or running water &ndash; got dressed in clean overalls for the big event.<br /><br />Here&rsquo;s how John described the occasion: &ldquo;My dad gave me something that day that would shape my entire life: my work, my marriage, my goals, my philosophy. It was a card on which his Dad had written out his creed. At the top, it read: 'Seven Things to Do.'<br />Those seven things:<br /><br /><ol><li>Be true to yourself.</li><li>Help Others.</li><li>Make each day your masterpiece.</li><li>Drink deeply from good books, especially the Bible.</li><li>Make friendship a fine art.</li><li>Build a shelter against a rainy day.</li><li>Pray for guidance and give thanks for your blessings every day.</li></ol><br />John played basketball in the barn with his three brothers and went on to be an All-American player at Purdue University in Indiana.<br /><br />When he left Purdue, John taught high-school English. He especially followed his Daddy's guidance about drinking deeply from good books.<br /><br />Some of the wisest, funniest, and best-traveled people who have ever lived have written their stories. Those stories are found in books that are here in the Goochland Elementary School library, or just up the road at the Goochland Public Library. They are waiting for you to discover, and I hope you will make it a priority to discover them. Ask your favorite teacher, or Mrs. McCay, or your Mother or Daddy; they will have a good recommendation, and a long summer is right ahead. "Drink deeply from good books."<br /><br />&ldquo;Make each day your masterpiece.&rdquo; John followed that advice in his classroom, in his 50-plus year marriage, and on the basketball practice court. John coached high school and college basketball, very well. He would start practice by explaining to his players how to wear socks, then he would teach his players how to shoot free throws (John once sank 134 free throw in a row during his playing days), and he taught them to master the full-court press. His teams, whether small and athletic, or led by a tall, dominant player, were trained in the daily masterpiece of John&rsquo;s practices.<br /><br />John viewed his practices and the teams he shaped and molded as a chance to &ndash; "Help others."<br /><br />Help others John did across four decades of coaching and advising young men. When the lists of the greatest coaches of all time are drawn up, they always include John&rsquo;s name. His UCLA Bruins&rsquo; teams won an unrivaled 10 national championships and once compiled an 88-game winning streak. His full name, as many of you have guessed, is John Wooden.<br /><br />When people asked John Wooden how he achieved what he did &ndash; the first man to make the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach, for example &ndash; he pointed to the creed taught to him by his father, Joshua Wooden. And he pulled out a card he carried with him from the day of his grade school graduation, a day much like today:<br /><br /><ol><li>Be true to yourself.</li><li>Help Others.</li><li>Make each day your masterpiece.</li><li>Drink deeply from good books, especially the Bible.</li><li>Make friendship a fine art.</li><li>Build a shelter against a rainy day.</li><li>Pray for guidance and give thanks for your blessings every day.</li></ol><br />Congratulations to you graduating fifth graders. May you build solidly on the foundation that has been laid by your parents and your Goochland Elementary School teachers - - the foundation upon which you now have the skills to begin to construct your life.<br /></div>

I am Delegate. Lee Ware from the 65th House District, and I bear greetings from Chesterfield, Goochland, Fluvanna, and Powhatan counties in central Virginia.<br /><br />As we meet late in spring, there are signs too, that it is late in the Republic. The need of our time is for leaders who cherish the sturdy political principles of our past and will champion them bravely and cheerfully in the days ahead.<br /><br />The men who will shortly appear on this stage, each of whom offers himself for our nomination to the United States Senate from Virginia, know the urgency of the fight to sustain the rule of law, a sane and balanced budget, an energy policy that taps our own abundant natural resources, and judges who will interpret the Constitution - - not spin confections of their favorite ideological flavor.<br /><br />These candidates know, too, that it will require diligent, steady work to restore America&rsquo;s standing as a dependable and respected presence on the world stage.<br /><br />It is an honor to join you as we select our standard-bearer for 2014. Unlike the man he will replace come January, our next Senator from Virginia will not vote for Harry Reid as Majority Leader nor support President Obama with his votes 97 percent of the time.<br /><br />So, let us hear these men today, measure their merits, and make our selection - - and emerge from this assembly wherever we sit and for whomever we vote as a united party prepared to labor together and to fight as our nominee will fight &ndash; happy warriors for our convictions, for our Commonwealth, and for the country we hold dear.<br /></div>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="5" color="#00a">Delegate Ware Welcomes Convention of the States</font><br /><strong>The Proposed Convention of States </strong><br />Remarks by Delegate Lee Ware, Powhatan, January, 10, 2014<br /><br />Any gathering of citizens devoted to preservation of the liberties that are uniquely ours as Virginians, and as Americans, is to be commended. In a famous assertion often attributed to Jefferson, but probably uttered by an Irish contemporary of his, we are reminded that "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."<br /><br />Tonight, the Convention of States (COS), a nation-wide endeavor, comes to Powhatan, and I both welcome you to our county and congratulate you upon undertaking labors that cannot but contribute to the well-being of our Commonwealth and, one may hope, our country.<br /><br />One of my own political lodestars, Edmund Burke, a contemporary of our Founders, urged his Irish and English countrymen to remember that it is the "little platoons," that is, the small communities, in which the virtues necessary to liberty are established, cultivated, and maintained. The COS meeting this evening is just such a "little platoon."<br /><br />When he left the Presidency in 1960, Dwight D. Eisenhower warned our parents' generation that there had arisen "a military-industrial complex" that threatened to accrue vast new powers to the national government in Washington. And he emphasized that, "Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together." I have emphasized the phrase, "an alert and knowledgeable citizenry," because the building up of just such a citizenry is what the COS project intends to achieve.<br /><br />James Madison, in Federalist Paper No. 51, predicted that the "mediating" structures, or associations, by which he meant private clubs, organizations, and so forth, would be the most important bulwark protecting the American people from the appetite for power of some of the politicians and bureaucracies in Washington. So I would suggest this evening that we remember that, while political associations and activities are urgently important, still, the genesis and the guardian of our liberties are alike to be found in maintaining the integrity and vitality of our free associations, that is, our private, civic, and religious organizations.<br /><br />Much of the impetus of the COS endeavor derives from the fact that our national government has amassed a debt that threatens the very well being of our children and our grandchildren--and even the younger among us in the room tonight. So I conclude these welcoming remarks by quoting yet again from the Sage of Monticello, who, well over two centuries ago, remarked, "I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them."<br /><br />May the COS contribute to the great cause of preventing our national government from wasting our labors and encroaching upon our liberties!<br /><br /><br /></div>
