  <h1 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;">Issues and Legislation</h1><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola has focused her legislative efforts on improving the health and wellbeing of children and families, particularly those who are most vulnerable and may need a helping hand to succeed. Senator Favola will always fight to ensure that each child gets a quality education, that all Virginians have access to health care, and that economic security is achievable for the middle class. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola chairs the Senate Rehabilitation and Social Services Committee, where she seeks to improve Virginia’s social safety nets and focuses on policies to improve Virginia’s penal system. Additionally, she chairs the Women’s Health Care Caucus in the Senate and has led the fight to stop the defunding of planned parenthood clinics throughout the state. Senator Favola is a strong pro-choice lawmaker; and she honors the privacy and dignity of every Virginian. Senator Favola is committed to creating a welcoming environment for our LGBTQ friends and neighbors. Stand with Senator Favola for a better and more inclusive Commonwealth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola served as the chief sponsor for the legislative proposals that are noted in each Issue area and have been signed into law.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Abortion &amp; Reproductive Access</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola helped defeat extreme and dangerous anti-abortion bills, including one that would have designated that life begins at conception. She was the chief patron of a bill prohibiting search warrants from seeking private data on menstrual cycle-tracking apps, which garnered national attention when blocked by the Youngkin Administration. Senator Favola is a strong supporter of an amendment that would guarantee the right to abortion care in the Virginia Constitution. Senator Favola chairs the Women’s Healthcare Caucus in the Senate.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Access to Voting</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola supports full and convenient access to the ballot. Voting is a cornerstone of our democracy, and efforts to frustrate certain groups from participating in this important civic duty are contrary to both the U.S. Constitution and the patriotic values of our nation. Senator Favola supports no-excuse absentee ballots, extended early voting, secure ballot drop boxes, and effective voter fraud safeguards. All of these ballot access measures were in place for the 2020 election, after which the Virginia Department of Elections conducted a statewide audit of the results. The audit found that the original count of votes from Virginia’s 2020 Election accurately portrayed the winners of the election. Senator Favola will continue to advocate for measures and legislation that ensure Virginia’s elections are accessible and accurate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Witness Signature on Absentee Ballots: </strong>Senator Favola sponsored passage of a new law that ends the requirements of a witness signature on an absentee ballot during a declared state of emergency due to a public health threat.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Children and Families</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola is married and has a grown son. Having been a working mom, she understands the challenges faced by Virginia families, and particularly Virginia’s working mothers and single parents. She has sponsored legislation and advocated both in committee and on the Senate floor for policies that will support the children and families of Virginia. She will continue to work to strengthen our communities and families to keep Virginia vibrant and thriving.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Preventing Child Abuse: </strong>Requires the investigation of alleged child abuse or neglect of children age 2 or younger. This early intervention could help reduce the number of infant fatalities in the Commonwealth. Last year, children younger than two counted for nearly half of all child fatalities.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Improving Oversight of Child Care Homes:</strong> Licensure of family day homes now requires that the children of a family day home provider and any children who reside in the family day home where care is provided shall be included in determining the number of children receiving care for the purpose of licensure. Child Care Homes and Centers must now advise parents if they are unlicensed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Ensuring Success for Foster Care Kids: </strong>The Fostering Futures program enables youth aged 18-21 who have aged out of the foster care system to continue with their education, job training, or employment opportunities. These kids already face greater obstacles than their peers, and fewer than 3% of them will graduate from a four-year college.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Climate Change</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola believes climate change is the foremost pressing challenge before us. She supports policies that will reduce the carbon emissions created in the state and hasten the economy’s conversion to sustainable, carbon-free energy. Senator Favola was a chief co-patron on the 2021 bill directing Virginia’s State Air Pollution Control Board to adopt California’s vehicle emission standards by 2024, making Virginia the first Southern state to adopt these ambitious standards. The legislation will reduce vehicular carbon emissions in Virginia and increase the availability of electric cars in the state. Senator Favola has also passed legislation creating the <strong>Commonwealth Clean Energy Plan</strong>, a framework that emphasizes strategies to achieve net zero carbon emissions in Virginia by 2045. The plan focuses on climate change mitigation, environmental justice goals, and needed transitions to a green economy. The Virginia Sierra Club has recognized the Senator as an Environmental Leader because of her work on the Commonwealth Clean Energy Plan.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Developmental Disabilities</strong></h2><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A COMMUNITY FOR EVERYONE</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On the Arlington Board, as a Northern Virginia leader, and now as a State Senator, Barbara will continue to focus particular attention on programs to support and integrate individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) into our community. Given the Department of Justice Report on the need to create the least restrictive environment for those with ID and developmental disabilities, Senator Favola is continuing to work with community leaders and non-profit providers to create community-based and tailored services for these individuals. She is a fierce advocate for reducing the Medicaid waver waiting list.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Supporting Disabled Children: </strong>Conner’s Law allows the court to order child support payments for adult children with severe disabilities.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Education (K-12)</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola is a strong advocate for funding K-12 public education. Funding K-12 education is the best investment the Commonwealth can make. Covid-19 has demonstrated our economy’s reliance on in-person schooling, as well as highlighted the need for universal access to broadband technology and the inadequacies of many of our school buildings. Now more than ever, Senator Favola believes that our classrooms need experienced teachers and our schools need counselors who can assist in alleviating the tremendous mental health stresses&nbsp;experienced by our students and their families&nbsp;as a result of Covid-19. Senator Favola was pleased to support the recent budgetary increases for teacher pay and additional school counselors. She will continue to lead legislative efforts to create more sustainable, efficient, and modern school buildings.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As our communities grow, so do classroom sizes. Senator Favola served on the Joint Committee to Study the Future of Public Elementary and Secondary Education in the Commonwealth. In this role, she worked to reduce the number of SOLs and was pleased to support passage of legislation that now only requires school systems to administer the federally mandated standardized tests.&nbsp;Senator Favola continues to work with school systems to create more meaningful ways of measuring student success. She understands the importance of small class sizes and values the contributions of teachers. Senator Favola continuously works to improve teacher-pay and reduce the number of SOLs. She understands that a student’s progress must be measured by more than one test. Senator Favola has also championed initiatives to make our schools safer, and served on the Senate Subcommittee on School Facility Modernization.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Anti-bullying Bill: </strong>Schools must establish anti-bullying policies, including policies addressing cyber bullying.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Public Charter School Authorization:&nbsp;</strong>Enables local public school systems to create a public charter school in cases where an existing public school is converted. Students who attended existing public schools, and their siblings,&nbsp;shall be given first priority at these public charter schools.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Teacher Evaluation: </strong>Senator Favola worked with the Virginia Education Association to extend from 5 business days to 10 business days before a teacher must decide to appeal an evaluation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Minimizing Seclusion and Restraint in Public Schools: </strong>Requires the Board of Education to adopt regulations on the use of seclusion and restraint in public elementary and secondary schools. The Washington Post editorial board<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/restraining-or-secluding-va-schoolchildren-demands-strict-guidelines/2015/01/24/6b7c727e-a1bd-11e4-b146-577832eafcb4_story.html" target="_blank"> endorsed</a> the bill, calling it “grounded in common sense.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Speed limits in School Zones:</strong> Allows counties in Planning District 8 to increase or decrease the speed limits on State owned roads in school zones; current law allows cities and towns to do so.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Equality</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola believes in equality for all. She believes that women should not face challenges in their communities or places of work solely because they are women. She believes that members of the LGBTQ community should be afforded the same rights as everyone else. She supports repealing Virginia’s Constitutional ban on gay marriage. And she believes that those who have immigrated to our communities from other countries should be welcomed and treated with equality.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola is committed to creating communities that are welcoming and inclusive. She vigorously fought against legislation that would draw local governments into the role of policing for the Federal Immigration &amp; Customs Agency (ICE). She has also supported legislation that allows "dreamers" to attend public colleges &amp; universities at the in-state tuition rate or to receive a tuition assistance grant if attending private institutions of higher learning. Senator Favola believes every individual should be treated with dignity and respect and given a chance to realize his/her dreams.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Hate Crimes: </strong>During the 2020 session, Senator Favola passed legislation adding the categories of gender, disability, gender identity, and sexual orientation to Virginia’s hate crimes statute.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Higher Education</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Employers in the region are struggling to fill high-demand jobs with local workers.&nbsp;Senator Favola collaborated with Governor Northam to create a no-cost option for students who wish to enter high-demand workforce tracks at their area community colleges. These tracks include computer technicians, nurses, cyber security analysts, and others. Senator Favola continues to be a strong advocate for increased funding for a dual-degree program that provides high-school (HS) students with the opportunity to take college level classes, and creates an opportunity for them to achieve an Associates degree upon graduation from HS. The dual degree program now offers certificate opportunities in the trades. Not all career-path jobs require a four year degree but all require some specialized training. Senator Favola&nbsp;feels strongly that enormous public benefits accrue when individuals who want to go to college are given an opportunity to do so without acquiring debt.&nbsp;Providing a no-cost option for many community college tracks also makes the attainment of a four year degree within the reach of many economically marginalized students. Senator Favola is always looking for ways to make higher education more affordable. She championed the Dual Degree Program and many other initiatives to reduce the cost of higher education and to enable individuals to pursue technical and trade opportunities that are so important in today’s economy.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Dual Degree Program: </strong>Increased funding to the Community College System to enable more course offerings at local high schools, so students can simultaneously achieve a high-school diploma and credits toward a trade certificate or Associate’s degree.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Trade &amp; Certificate Scholarships: </strong>Scholarship dollars are now available to former foster kids wishing to pursue trade or certificate programs through the Community College System. This effort will help Virginia reach its goal of 100,000 additional degrees or certificates by 2020; our most vulnerable kids will be given an opportunity to achieve their dreams.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Growing the Economy &amp; Supporting Workers</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola believes that we must support workers to achieve a full recovery from the&nbsp;impacts of COVID-19 and to nurture growth and resiliency in Virginia’s economy. She supports a living wage for all workers and is committed to raising the current minimum wage to $15.00 an hour, over time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a member of the Arlington County Board, Senator Favola ensured that county contracts were issued to businesses willing to pay a living wage. She also believes strongly in wage protection laws and the right of workers to participate in collective bargaining. Senator Favola also realizes that an important element in delivering quality construction and transportation projects is the use of&nbsp;Project Labor Agreements (PLAs).&nbsp;These agreements give management and labor the tools they need to deliver projects that meet high safety standards, conform to budget constraints and meet ambitious time lines. In fact, the first phase of the Silver Line Metro extension was build on-time and within budget as a result of a PLA.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Women have left the workforce in disproportionately high numbers as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. To help all workers, but particularly women, to re-enter the workforce, Senator Favola will continue to offer legislation that requires employers to provide employees with the economic supports necessary to care for their families.&nbsp;These include such things as paid sick leave, paid family and medical leave, and increased opportunities to access quality, affordable childcare.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Paid Family &amp; Medical Leave: </strong>Senator Favola passed a bill in 2021 directing the Bureau of Insurance to convene a workgroup to make recommendations on what legislative changes are needed to allow the sale of private paid family and medical leave insurance policies in the Commonwealth as part of the overall policy goal of establishing statewide paid family and medical leave.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Gun Safety &amp; Domestic Violence Prevention</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola has worked tirelessly to reduce the incidence of gun violence in Virginia and to prevent domestic violence. Senator Favola seeks to pass laws that will reduce mass gun violence, homicides, and suicide. Virginians should be able to live, work, go to school, and worship in safe settings that are free of gun violence. She understands that a balance must be reached between gun ownership rights and gun safety laws, but is committed to reducing the incidence of gun violence in Virginia. Annually, one in three homicides in Virginia is connected to domestic violence: a rate that is much too high. Senator Favola serves on the Virginia Advisory Committee on Sexual and Domestic Violence and seeks to implement policies to reduce the incidence of sexual and domestic violence in the Commonwealth. She will sponsor legislation to ban assault weapons, outlaw ghost guns, and require safe storage of firearms. Senator Favola passed the following bills:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Protecting Family &amp; Household Members:</strong> Senator Favola passed legislation removing firearms from those convicted of assault of a household member, helping stop the escalation of violence. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Protection Order Violation: </strong>This measure makes carrying a firearm a Class 6 felony if the abuser knowingly possesses a firearm while in violation of a protective order. A class 6 felony charge carries an incarceration sentence of up to 5 years and/ or a fine of up to $2,500.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Best Interests of the Child:</strong> When a judge is determining the best interests of a child for purposes of determining custody or visitation, the court will now be required to consider past allegations of child abuse or any act of violence, force, or threat within the previous ten years.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Virginia Gun Violence Intervention and Prevention Fund: </strong>This fund has been established to provide grants to local government agencies, community-based organizations, and hospitals for the purpose of supporting implementation of evidence-informed violence intervention and prevention efforts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Helping Victims of Sexual Assault: </strong>Senator Favola worked with the Office of the Attorney General on a bill to require that sexual assault survivors be informed if physical evidence submitted prior to July 1, 2016, contains DNA evidence.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reporting Acts of Campus Sexual Violence: </strong>Requiring universities to create memorandums of understanding with local sexual assault crisis centers and to provide survivors with access to other community resources.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Preventing Sexual Assault: </strong>Senator Favola’s Bar Bystander Bill encourages bartenders and others who serve or sell spirits in an ABC licensed or permitted establishments to undergo training to help prevent risky situations from culminating into sexual assaults.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Health Care</strong></h2><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a breast cancer survivor, Senator Favola knows first-hand how important it is to have access to health care,&nbsp;She has worked hard to make healthcare affordable, as well as to protect a woman's right to choose. Senator Favola chairs the Women's Health Care Caucus in the Senate. She will always be a champion for improving access to women’s health care, especially for our marginalized and under-served communities. Senator Favola serves on the Joint Commission on Health Care and is leading efforts to expand subsidies and control increases in insurance premiums so more Virginians can have access to affordable health care.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola works tirelessly to make the health care system affordable and accessible. She has focused on improving preventive care, post-hospital care, and home-health care.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>No Surprise Medical Billing:</strong> This piece of landmark legislation was negotiated and passed by Senator Favola in the 2020 General Assembly Session. The law bans providers and insurance companies from billing patients for out-of-network emergency care or surgery in excess of their deductible and/or co-payment. Insurance companies and providers now must negotiate a reimbursement rate for this care, leaving the patient harmless, rather than billing to the patient what could be very excessive charges.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Essential Benefits: </strong>Enshrines the protections provided by the ACA into state law, so that Virginia health plans must include coverage for essential benefits for preventative care services despite any erosion of benefit protection at the federal level that may happen. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Nutritional Health for Seniors: </strong>The Council on Aging must now educate consumers on malnutrition and provide strategies for defeating this issue. Today, 13.9% of Virginia seniors are food insecure.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Care Act: </strong>The law requires hospitals to give patients the opportunity to designate an individual who will help with patient care.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Monitoring of Home Health Care Workers: </strong>Requires a director of a licensed home health care organization and a director of a licensed hospice organization to report certain disciplinary actions against health professionals to the Office of Licensure and Certification at the Department of Health.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH HEALTHCARE</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola recognizes that access to mental health healthcare is integral to comprehensive healthcare and a healthy Virginia. She supports access to mental health services at affordable rates and ending the historical stigma attached to the need for mental health services. Senator Favola’s work has included working with Senator Deeds on a bill to require that the State keep a registry of available psychiatric beds. The bill also requires State facilities to make a bed available if a local bed cannot be located should an individual need to be temporarily detained for a complete psychiatric evaluation. In separate legislation,&nbsp;Senator Favola has also focused on better funding mental health services for children.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Critical Incident Reporting: </strong>Senator Favola passed legislation to require better reporting on incidents of serious injury from licensed community-based programs serving those with intellectual or developmental disabilities.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Reporting of Allegations of Abuse or Neglect:</strong> Senator Favola strengthened the protections for those living in licensed group homes by requiring the state to report allegations of abuse or neglect to the Commonwealth’s designated protection and advocacy system.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Immigration Status and State Mental Health Facilities: </strong>This legislation removes language from the Code requiring state mental health facilities to determine and report the immigration status of patients upon their admission.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Policing &amp; Criminal Justice Reform</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The horrific death of George Floyd (June 2020) and other tragic examples of racially biased policing shined a bright light on the need to make systemic and societal changes at the national, state, and local levels. Black Americans have been denied justice and equality for far too long.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola is a strong believer in the need to eradicate racism in policing and criminal justice practices. She played a significant role in the passage of legislation to support the universal use of body cameras, encourage community policing strategies, and require training on how to develop community trust between law enforcement and various ethnic and racial constituencies.&nbsp;Additionally, Senator Favola advocated for more accountability measures such as the creation of Citizen Review Boards, and funding to support mental health professionals working side by side with the police.&nbsp;Most recently, she supported and sponsored legislation that institutes criminal sentencing reform, expunges certain criminal convictions, and decriminalizes the simple possession of marijuana.&nbsp;Senator Favola has been a long-time advocate of repealing the death penalty, and rigorously advocated for the successful abolition of the death penalty during the 2021 General Assembly session.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">More needs to be done to erase ingrained racism in our policing, judicial and prison systems.&nbsp;As Chair of the Rehabilitation and Social Services Committee, Senator Favola will continue to propose and guide legislation that values rehabilitative and restorative justice. She will work towards creating a more just, more fair, and more equitable society.</p><h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Transportation</strong></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Senator Favola understands that Northern Virginians spend hours in their cars commuting back and forth to work everyday. As a member of the Senate Transportation Committee, she will continue to work to come up with new and innovative ways to improve our roads and decrease commuter times. She also believes it is important to focus on greener transportation methods, such as public transit, and to identify a dedicated source of revenue to achieve a safe and reliable metro system throughout the region.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Metrorail Safety Commission Interstate Compact: </strong>Senator Favola, in collaboration with other members of the Transportation Committee, worked to pass a compact that authorizes Virginia to become a signatory to the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission Interstate Compact. The compact establishes a safety oversight authority for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). It does contain an emergency clause, which means it won’t go into effect until the State of Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Congress all approve the Compact. The bill includes measures necessary to better ensure the safety of riders and employees, including safety in the event of a homeland security emergency in the national capital area; and financial and operational improvements necessary to ensure that WMATA’s performance is at least as efficient as its closest comparable transit systems in the United States.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Supporting Dulles Airport: </strong>Senator Favola was an effective advocate to ensure that<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Dulles Airport received a $50 million allocation to offset expenses associated with keeping this airport a major national and international hub. Airports from around Virginia advocated for this funding because so many connecting flights go through Dulles. Dulles is a major economic engine for the region and the State.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>I-66 Expansion:&nbsp;</strong>Senator Favola was part of the deal that negotiated <a href="http://www.virginiadot.org/projects/corridors/interstate_66_projects.asp" target="_blank">expanding I-66</a> from I-495 inside the beltway heading east. The Senator understands how important it is to improve commuting options for her constituents.</p>
