				<div class="paragraph"><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">As baseball legend Yogi Berra said,&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46); font-weight:bold">&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t over till it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">&nbsp;While the General Assembly convened last Wednesday to vote on the long-delayed budget (I voted yes), the Governor could still propose amendments or even veto provisions.&nbsp;Today, the Governor signed the Budget Bill&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=232&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb6001" target="_blank">(</a><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=232&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb6001" target="_blank">HB6001</a><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">) as passed by the General Assembly.&nbsp;Meaning that it is truly over, for now.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">While the press has covered many of the higher-level items of the budget, I know my constituents enjoy getting into the details!&nbsp;But before I do that, a couple of other items.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46); font-weight:bold">House and Senate Page Program</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">Attention parents!&nbsp;Each year, students from across Virginia become part of the General Assembly family by participating in the Senate and House Page programs.&nbsp;This is a unique opportunity for our future leaders to get a first-hand look at how government works and build friendships that last a lifetime.&nbsp;Applicants must be 13 or 14 years old on the first day of session (second Wednesday of January).&nbsp;</span><a href="https://capclass.virginiageneralassembly.gov/PagePrograms/PagePrograms.html" target="_blank">Click here for more information and the application process</a><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">.&nbsp;The deadline is October 16.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me if I can help answer any questions.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46); font-weight:bold">Redistricting</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">I&rsquo;ve proudly represented the 37th District in the House of Delegates since 2006.&nbsp;As many of you know, the recent redistricting process resulted in new boundaries and district numbers.&nbsp;Most of 37th District is now in the new 11th District.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">The new 11th District consists of the City of Fairfax and the current 37th District precincts of University, Villa, Monument, Mosby #1, and Eagle View #1.&nbsp;New precincts include Hunters Branch, Blake, Oakton, Flint Hill #2, Difficult Run, Oaktree Crossing, Penderbrook, Island Pond, and Centrepoint.&nbsp;I am thrilled to be running for re-election in the new 11th District and look forward to meeting my new constituents.&nbsp;I am, however, very sorry to lose my Centreville precincts and areas south of Braddock Road, including Middleridge, Country Club View, and Fairfax Club Estates.&nbsp;Should I be fortunate enough to be re-elected, please consider yourselves honorary constituents.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">Visit&nbsp;</span><a href="https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/" target="_blank">Who&rsquo;s My Legislator</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">to find out how redistricting affected your community.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46); font-weight:bold">Budget Package</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">The primary disagreement between the House and Senate (and Governor) revolved around tax policy.&nbsp;The final budget includes:</span><br /><br /><span></span><ul style="color:rgb(64, 63, 66)"><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Rebates</span><span>.&nbsp;One-time rebates of $200 for single filers and $400 for joint filers, totaling approximately $906M</span><span></span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Standard Deduction</span><span>.&nbsp;Increases the standard deduction to $8,500 for single filers and $17,000 for joint filers.&nbsp;The current deduction is $8,000/$16,000.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Military Retirement</span><span>.&nbsp;In 2022, the General Assembly passed a bill to exempt up to $40,000 in military retirement benefits from the income tax for individuals over age 55.&nbsp;The budget removes the minimum age provision.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Sales Tax Holiday</span><span>.&nbsp;Reinstates the sales tax holiday for school supplies, emergency preparedness products items, and Energy Star and WaterSense products.&nbsp;The tax holiday will be held the third weekend in October.</span></li></ul><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">Not included in the budget were the Governor&rsquo;s proposals to decrease the corporate income tax rate from 6% to 5% and to cut the top individual income tax rate from 5.75% to 5.5%.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">In terms of expenditures, the adopted budget takes a cautious view of the fiscal environment and assumes that revenue growth will likely slow.</span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">&nbsp;As a result, the focus is on one-time initiatives over increasing ongoing programs or creating new programs.</span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">&nbsp;Approximately $3.5B is directed toward non-recurring activities while $1.1 billion goes toward ongoing programs.&nbsp;I think this is a prudent approach.</span><br /><br /><span></span><ul style="color:rgb(64, 63, 66)"><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Economic Development</span><span>.&nbsp;$200M for the Business Ready Sites Program.&nbsp;This program is a key component of Virginia&rsquo;s economic development strategy by identifying potential industrial sites and assisting with site preparation and development.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Direct Aid for Schools</span><span>.&nbsp;$908M increase for the state&rsquo;s share of school funding.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Teacher Salaries</span><span>.&nbsp;$55M for an additional 2% salary increase for teachers effective January 2024 (this is on top of an already approved 5% increase).</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">School Support Positions</span><span>.&nbsp;$153M to temporarily lift the cap on funding for school support positions.&nbsp;Support staff include maintenance workers/custodians, food service staff, technology support, etc.&nbsp;The cap was put in place in response to the 2008 Great Recession and was never lifted.&nbsp;This had the impact of shifting the entire cost burden to Fairfax County Public Schools.&nbsp;Making this provision permanent will be a big focus of the 2024 General Assembly (and one of my top priorities).</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Flexible Education Funding</span><span>.&nbsp;$418M in one-time flexible funding.&nbsp;School systems are encouraged to use the funding to address COVID-19 learning loss.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Higher Education Affordability</span><span>.&nbsp;$137M to increase access and affordability of higher education, including $63M in undergraduate financial aid.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Workforce Development</span><span>.&nbsp;$8.4M to the community college system for workforce development and career and technical education programs.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Developmental Disability Waivers</span><span>.&nbsp;$10.5M to add an additional 500 DD waiver slots.&nbsp;DD waivers are essential for providing children and adults with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities with a wide range of critical support services.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Mental Health Services</span><span>.&nbsp;$156M in new spending to support mental health services, including $58M to create crisis receiving centers and crisis stabilization units and $34M permanent supportive housing for individuals with serious mental illness.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Community Services Boards</span><span>.&nbsp;$22M to partially fill a long-standing funding gap for local community services.&nbsp;The Fairfax-Falls Church CSB provides essential services to individuals with mental illness, substance abuse disorders, and developmental disabilities.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Crime Prevention</span><span>.&nbsp;Funding for crime prevention, including $15M for Operation Ceasefire, $5M for the Firearm Violence Intervention and Prevention Program, and $10M for the Safer Communities Program.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Water Quality Improvement Fund</span><span>.&nbsp;$645M for water quality projects, including $30M for the Stormwater Local Assistance Fund (one of my budget requests).</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">Climate Change Resilience</span><span>.&nbsp;$100M for the Resilient Virginia Revolving Loan Fund.&nbsp;This funds my legislation from last year and helps localities and private businesses to prepare for the impacts of climate change.</span></li><li style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"><span style="font-weight:bold">State Employee Raise</span><span>.&nbsp;$61M to provide most state employees, including university employees) an additional 2% raise effective December 2023 (this is on top of an already approved 5% increase).</span></li></ul><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">Another useful piece of information is how much additional funding will be provided to Fairfax County Public Schools</span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">.&nbsp;Direct aid to Fairfax County will go from $959,115,532 in FY23 to $1,006,832,068 in FY24.&nbsp;Direct aid to the City of Fairfax will go from $11,066,754 in FY23 to 11,517,141 in FY24.</span><br /><br /><span></span><a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Key-Budget-Policy-Choices-2023-conference.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a><span

Appropriations staff</a><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">&nbsp;that provides a great overview by policy area.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46); font-weight:bold">Summer Homework &ndash; Legislative Commissions</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">Although we are a part-time legislature, General Assembly members are appointed to various commissions that meet throughout the year.&nbsp;This allows us to focus on specific issues and develop recommendations for action outside of the pressure of the regular session.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">Here are a few highlights of the commissions on which I serve:</span><br /><br /><span></span><ul style="color:rgb(64, 63, 66)"><li><a href="https://www.chesbay.us/" target="_blank">Chesapeake Bay Commission</a><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">.&nbsp;This is a tri-state commission made up of legislators from Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;Our most recent meeting was in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where we discussed efforts to meet Bay restoration targets as well as potential solutions to the growing problem of PFAS contamination, otherwise known as &ldquo;forever&rdquo; chemicals.&nbsp;Other recent meetings have focused on the problem of invasive blue catfish and declining blue crab stocks.</span></li><li><a href="https://dls.virginia.gov/commissions/swc.htm?x=mtg" target="_blank">State Water Commission</a><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">.&nbsp;This commission is charged with studying all aspects of water supply &ndash; including quality and quantity.&nbsp;Our August agenda focused on water supply improvements being implemented through the American Rescue Plan Act and a shortage of certified water treatment plant operators.&nbsp;We also discussed the impact of proposed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency PFAS standards on water suppliers like Fairfax Water.&nbsp;</span></li><li><a href="https://vhc.virginia.gov/" target="_blank">Housing Commission</a><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">.&nbsp;Our August meeting included a presentation on economic, demographic, and housing market trends in Virginia.&nbsp;Bottom line: we desperately need more affordable housing!&nbsp;Earlier that day, I led a workgroup to discuss derelict buildings, the foreclosure process in homeowner associations, and the need for electric vehicle charging stations in new multi-family housing communities.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.education.virginia.gov/initiatives/commission-on-early-childhood-care-and-education/" target="_blank">Early Childhood Care and Education Commission</a><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)">.&nbsp;The commission includes legislators as well as representatives from businesses, economic development, local government, school divisions, parents, and early care and education providers.&nbsp;The commission is brand new, but we have already started to tackle a wide range of topics, including affordability, accessibility, and how to attract and retain quality providers.</span></li></ul><span style="font-weight:bold">It is an honor to serve you in the House of Delegates!</span><span>&nbsp;As always, I welcome your thoughts and feedback!</span><br

				<div class="paragraph"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">Thanks to everyone who came out to my Town Hall meeting earlier this month.&nbsp;We had a great turn out and lots of good discussion.&nbsp;If you missed it, the event can be viewed in its entirety on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fairfax.granicus.com/player/clip/2995?view_id=11&amp;redirect=true&amp;h=fbeda75fc035eb7dc59e8835439a53f9" target="_blank" style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">CityScreen-12</a><span style="letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: transparent;">.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">They don&rsquo;t call it a short session for nothing!</span><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153)">&nbsp;</span><span>The past two weeks have flown by.&nbsp;February 7 was &ldquo;cross-over,&rdquo; which is traditionally the busiest day of the session.&nbsp;Cross-over is the half-way point where the House and Senate must complete work on their own bills.&nbsp;During a roughly eight-hour span we acted on over 145 bills.&nbsp;These included everything from very simple bills to extremely complicated subjects such as digital tokens and decentralized autonomous organizations (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1784" target="_blank">HB1784</a><span>).&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.techslang.com/definition/what-is-a-digital-token/" target="_blank">Click here</a><span>&nbsp;for a quick explanation in case you are similarly challenged in this area!&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="font-weight:bold">Budget Negotiations</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>On February 9, the House and Senate acted on their respective versions of the budget.&nbsp;Since Virginia has a biennial budget process, this year we are amending the two-year budget adopted last year.&nbsp;The Governor introduces the initial amendments, and then the House and Senate add and subtract accordingly.&nbsp;Both budgets have plenty to like &ndash; and some things to dislike.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Here are just a few of the major differences in the three budgets</span><span>&nbsp;(Governor&rsquo;s original and the House and Senate changes):</span><br /><br /><span></span><ul style="color:rgb(64, 63, 66)"><li><span style="font-weight:bold">K-12 Education.</span><span>&nbsp;All three budgets increase funding for direct aid to school divisions, although the Senate investment ($1.02B) is about triple the amount proposed by the Governor ($321.1M) and the House ($382.8M).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Teacher and State Employee Salaries.&nbsp;</span><span>While the Governor proposed a one-time bonus, the House and Senate converted that to a 2% salary increase.&nbsp;This approach will better help our employees to keep up with the impacts of inflation.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Reading Specialists.</span><span>&nbsp;All three budgets increase money for reading specialists, with significantly more by the House ($30.8M) and Senate ($51.1M) than the Governor ($16.9M).&nbsp;This funding is an important part of the plan to address COVID learning loss.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Higher Education.</span><span>&nbsp;Both the House ($75.6M) and Senate ($224.8M) include additional funding aimed at making higher education more affordable.&nbsp;No additional funding was proposed in the Governor&rsquo;s budget.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Health Care.&nbsp;</span><span>All three budgets include funding for 500 additional developmental disability (DD) waiver slots.&nbsp;They also increase Medicaid reimbursement rates that are critical to quality health delivery services.&nbsp;However, the Senate increase ($210M) is significantly larger than the House ($53.8M) and Governor ($42.7M).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Mental Health.</span><span>&nbsp;The Governor proposed much needed funding ($58.3M) for crisis receiving centers and stabilization units.&nbsp;The House ($83.3M) and Senate ($88.3M) add additional funds in this chronically underfunded area of government.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Water Quality.&nbsp;</span><span>All three budgets increase funding for water quality and Chesapeake Bay restoration.&nbsp;This is one area where the House ($432.3M) outdid (slightly) the Senate ($427M).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Resilience.</span><span>&nbsp;The Governor and Senate propose $200M for the Resilient Virginia Revolving Loan Fund, while the House includes $100M (still a hefty amount).</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Economic Development.</span><span>&nbsp;All three budgets include significant new funding for economic development, including site readiness for large projects.&nbsp;The House and Governor include $500M while the Senate has $300M.</span></li></ul><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">I am pleased that several of my initiatives made their way into the House budget.</span><span>&nbsp;These include:</span><br /><br /><span></span><ul style="color:rgb(64, 63, 66)"><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Livable Homes Tax Credit.</span><span>&nbsp;Increases the total cap on the Livable Homes Tax Credit program from $1M to $2M.&nbsp;This program is designed to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and helps older adults by allowing them to retrofit their homes and age in place.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Teacher Mentoring Program.</span><span>&nbsp;Adds $630K to support and expand REACH Virginia.&nbsp;This mentorship program is designed to help new teachers succeed for the long-term.&nbsp;Supporting new teachers through mentorship is a key element to addressing Virginia&rsquo;s current teacher shortage.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Chesapeake Bay Restoration.</span><span>&nbsp;Adds $10M to the Stormwater Local Assistance Fund (SLAF).&nbsp;This program provides grants to localities so that they can clean up polluted urban stormwater.&nbsp;This has the dual benefits of improving local streams as well as the Chesapeake Bay.</span></li></ul><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">My greatest concern with the House budget is that it retains the Governor&rsquo;s proposal to reduce the corporate income tax rate from 6% to 5%.</span><span>&nbsp;Last year, the General Assembly cut taxes by $4B, most of which were targeted toward working-class Virginians.&nbsp;This additional cut has the potential to throw our budget out of balance &ndash; since our forecasters predict an economic downturn during 2023.&nbsp;In addition, most businesses I have talked to don&rsquo;t consider our corporate tax rate to be unreasonable.&nbsp;It is squarely in the middle compared to other states.&nbsp;However, many businesses have cited investment in workforce development, site readiness, transportation infrastructure, and K-12 education as key factors in choosing to do business in Virginia &ndash; things that will be at risk if we lose an additional $362M in revenue.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>You can find a good side-by-side comparison of the budgets by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Key-Budget-Policy-Choices-2023-committees.pdf" target="_blank">Commonwealth Institute</a><span>. A detailed overview by the House Appropriations Committee staff can be&nbsp;</span><a href="https://hac.virginia.gov/Committee/files/2023/2-8-23/House%20Budget%20Briefing%202-8-23.pdf" target="_blank">found here</a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>The budget bill is now in conference where differences between the House and Senate versions are being worked out.&nbsp;I am looking forward to reviewing the final recommendations.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="font-weight:bold">Unsung Hero Bills</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Workforce Development</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>This week, the General Assembly passed legislation to create a new Department of Workforce Development and Advancement (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2195" target="_blank">HB2195</a><span>).&nbsp;The Department will be responsible for administering workforce development programs and overseeing a coordinated approach to</span><span style="color:black">&nbsp;program evaluation and data sharing.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>In 2019, the Southern Regional Education Board (on which I serve as an advisory member) published&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sreb.org/publication/unprepared-and-unaware" target="_blank">&ldquo;Unprepared and Unaware.&rdquo;</a><span>&nbsp;The document was a wakeup call that states need to not only focus more on workforce development &ndash; but also shift to highly adaptable programs that can keep up with wildly shifting workforce needs.&nbsp;The report notes that up to 44% of current manual work activities in the Unites States could be automated by 2030 and that &ldquo;by 2030, between 3% and 14% of the global workforce will need to be able to perform a completely different job function than the one they did in 2016.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>While Virginia has made significant investments in workforce development, these programs are scattered among several different agencies.&nbsp;This new legislation will ensure that Virginia has an overall strategy for dealing with shifting technologies and market forces.&nbsp;That said, it is important to get this right!&nbsp;Simply consolidating programs, without linking them to industry experts in the field, can do more harm than good.&nbsp;But after many iterations, this bi-partisan effort was passed on a nearly unanimous vote.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Blue Lights!</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>Once upon a time, if a car was coming toward you and you were being blinded, it meant that the person forgot to turn off their high beams.&nbsp;Today, being blinded by an oncoming car is just as likely to come from purposefully installed &ldquo;blue lights.&rdquo;&nbsp;While these xenon (as opposed to halogen) bulbs can certainly light up the road, they are also a safety hazard for everyone else.&nbsp;There is a scientific reason for this.&nbsp;Not only are the bulbs brighter, but the blue wavelength achieves greater penetration into the retina, which results in more glare than other colors.&nbsp;The same phenomenon happens with blue holiday lights.&nbsp;They are pretty &ndash; but it is hard to look at them for a long period of time.</span><br /><br /><span></span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb855" target="_blank">SB855</a><span>&nbsp;prohibits aftermarket modifications that make headlights appear as a blue light.&nbsp;The bill passed the House 87Y-11N and is now headed to the Governor.</span>&#8203;<br /><br /><span></span><span style="font-weight:bold">Now that session is wrapping up, I am happy to attend community meetings to provide an overview of issues debated and to get your feedback.</span><span>&nbsp;If you are interested, please reach out to my legislative assistant, Rama Van Pelt, at&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:deldbulova@house.virginia.gov" target="_blank">deldbulova@house.virginia.gov</a><span>&nbsp;or (703) 310-6752.</span><br /><span></span></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span>The first two and a half weeks of the General Assembly session have been a whirlwind of activity.&nbsp;Floor sessions are now getting longer as legislation starts to report out of the committees.&nbsp;Thanks to the many constituents who visited me in Richmond to advocate for (and against) a wide range of issues.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="font-weight:bold">I am excited to be holding my annual Town Hall meeting next Saturday, February 4 from 9-11 a.m. at Fairfax City Hall.</span><span>&nbsp;We will be joined by Senator Chap Petersen.&nbsp;The meeting will include an overview of major issues, the status of our legislative initiatives, and lots of time for Q&amp;A.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>This past week I spoke on the House floor against&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1485" target="_blank">HB1485</a><span>, which would undermine key legislation passed in 2020 to ensure that Virginia meets its Chesapeake Bay restoration targets.&nbsp;The 2020 legislation set a deadline of 2026 for larger agricultural operations to implement nutrient management plans and fence livestock out of streams.&nbsp;HB1485 would move that target to 2030, placing Virginia at risk of not meeting U.S. EPA mandates and risking penalties that would most likely target urban areas like Northern Virginia.&nbsp;While the bill passed on a 52Y-47N vote, I am hopeful that it will either be defeated or significantly amended in the Senate.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="font-weight:bold">Update on My Legislation</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>So far, three of my bills have made it through committee, including one that has now passed the House and is on its way to the Senate.</span><br /><br /><span></span><ul><li><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2095" target="_blank">HB2095</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">&ndash;

Out of State Vehicles</span><span>.&nbsp;This bill deals with the problem of vehicles that are garaged in Virginia but where the owner purposefully fails to license and register the vehicle.&nbsp;This is done to avoid taxes, which means the rest of us pick up the slack.&nbsp;HB2340 increases the penalties to keep up with inflation so that they remain effective deterrents.</span></li></ul><span>Unfortunately, my legislation (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2102" target="_blank">HB2102</a><span>) to address the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">problem of purposefully loud mufflers</span><span>&nbsp;failed to report out of subcommittee.&nbsp;However, I am pleased that the chair of the Transportation Committee signaled his intent to create a task force composed of legislators, State Police, and other stakeholders to develop recommendations for next session.&nbsp;I am looking forward to participating on this task force.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="font-weight:bold">Unsung Hero Bill &ndash; Nursing Home Standards</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>While there is no shortage of controversial bills that are highlighted in the news, I like to highlight good bills that often don&rsquo;t get the attention they deserve.&nbsp;One of these deals with minimum staffing standards for nursing homes.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>This issue has been debated in the General Assembly for as long as I&rsquo;ve served in the House.&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(33, 37, 41)">Virginia is one of only 12 states with no laws setting minimum standards.&nbsp;According to a report from the&nbsp;</span><as%20Nursing%20Homes%20Final%20Report%20-%20updated%20with%20technical%20changes%20Nov%209.pdf" href="http://jchc.virginia.gov/Workforce%20Challenges%20in%20Virginia's%20Nursing%20Homes%20Final%20Report%20-%20updated%20with%20technical%20changes%20Nov%209.pdf" target="_blank">Virginia Joint Commission on Health Care</a><span style="color:rgb(33, 37, 41)">, one-fifth of Virginia&rsquo;s nursing homes do not meet expected staffing levels.&nbsp;Further, m</span><span>ore than 60 percent of facilities with low staffing receive poor health inspection ratings, which includes criteria such as medication management and resident quality of life.&nbsp;The impact of understaffing is greatest on low-income residents.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="color:black">This may finally be the year that we pass minimum standards!&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1446" target="_blank">HB1446</a><span style="color:black">&nbsp;sets&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(55, 54, 65)">minimum hourly standards for daily care per resident&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black">and imposes administrative sanctions on those out of compliance.&nbsp;The bill is up for debate on the House floor this Monday.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="font-weight:bold">Raise the Red Flag Bill &ndash;

				<div class="paragraph"><span style="color:rgb(45, 44, 46)"></span><span>And we are off!&nbsp;The 2023 General Assembly session sprang to life on January 11 with the crack of the gavel.&nbsp;Thus began our 46-day sprint to consider&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+lst+ALL" target="_blank">1,800+ bills</a><span>&nbsp;and several hundred proposed amendments to the biennial budget.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="font-weight:bold">Mark your calendar for my annual Town Hall meeting on Saturday, February 4, from 9-11 a.m.</span><span>&nbsp;This is one of my favorite traditions and I&rsquo;m excited that we will be returning to Fairfax City Hall.&nbsp;The meeting will include an overview of major issues and then lots of time for robust Q&amp;A.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>Thank you to everyone who emailed in response to my last newsletter, where I invited feedback on the Governor&rsquo;s budget amendments and other priorities.&nbsp;I am still working through responses &ndash; but please know that I have read them all and greatly appreciate the input.&nbsp;I also want to share a more comprehensive overview of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://hac.virginia.gov/Committee/files/2023/1-12-23/2023%20Introduced%20Budget%20Briefing.pdf" target="_blank">Governor&rsquo;s proposed amendments</a><span>&nbsp;by our House Appropriations Committee for those who are interested in more details.</span><br /><br /><span></span><span style="font-weight:bold">My Legislation</span><br /><br /><span></span><span>This year I have introduced 14 bills dealing with a wide range of issues.&nbsp;Below are a few highlights.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+mbr+H177C" target="_blank">Click here for the full list</a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span></span><ul style="color:rgb(64, 63, 66)"><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Workers Compensation for Dispatchers</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1631" target="_blank">HB1631</a><span>&nbsp;would enhance workers compensation benefits for our emergency dispatchers.&nbsp;Specifically, it would make it easier for dispatchers suffering from PTSD to get help.&nbsp;Dispatchers work under extremely stressful situations &ndash; being on calls with victims in burning homes, burglaries in progress, suicide attempts, armed robberies, fatal auto accidents, sexual assaults, and more.&nbsp;A recent study found that 8% of dispatchers themselves had recent thoughts about suicide.&nbsp;Making sure that these public servants get the help they need should be a priority.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Tenant Protections</span><span>.&nbsp;When a tenant moves into a rental unit, at the very least it should be safe and habitable, right? &nbsp;Unfortunately, there are people who get the keys to a new unit and find it uninhabitable due to serious safety and health problems.&nbsp;Right now, that person is faced with two options &ndash; move into an unsafe situation or find another place to live while they try to hold the landlord accountable.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1635" target="_blank">HB1635</a><span>&nbsp;makes it clear that a tenant deserves to move into a habitable unit and allows them to break the lease and get their deposit back when the unit is unsafe.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Invasive Plants</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2096" target="_blank">HB2096</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51)">is designed to slow the spread of invasive plants that have taken over so many of our stream valleys and open spaces.&nbsp;This bill would require state agencies (including VDOT, public universities, parks, etc.) to lead by example by prohibiting invasive plants in new landscaping.&nbsp;It would also require landscaping contractors to inform a property owner when they propose to use an invasive plant &ndash; therefore giving the customer the opportunity to say &ldquo;No thanks!&rdquo;&nbsp;I was thrilled that a local native plant enthusiast dropped off a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://virginiawildflowers.org/2015/06/29/fringed-loosestrife/" target="_blank">native fringed loosestrife</a><span style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51)">&nbsp;as a thank you.&nbsp;Sorry Gretchen, it is not our color scheme but you will love the flowers!</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Drought Planning</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2095" target="_blank">HB2095</a><span>&nbsp;strengthens our region&rsquo;s drought management and planning efforts by recognizing the Potomac River as its own planning unit and making sure that our interstate plans are coordinated with state-wide plans.&nbsp;Two-thirds of our water comes from the Potomac River and 60% of the watershed is outside of Virginia &ndash; making interstate cooperation essential.&nbsp;I am pleased that this bill has passed committee and will come to a vote in the full House on Monday.</span></li><li><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">Livable Homes</span><span style="color:black">.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2099" target="_blank">HB2099</a><span style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51)">&nbsp;would increase the total cap on the Livable Homes Tax Credit program from $1 million to $2 million.&nbsp;This great program is designed to help people with mobility issues stay in their homes by providing a tax credit for retrofits.&nbsp;Retrofits include things like ramps and widening doorways.&nbsp;While very successful, the program cannot keep up with demand. The total amount has not been increased since it was established in 1999. &nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/lhtc" target="_blank">Click here for more information about the Livable Homes Tax Credit.</a><span style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51)">&nbsp;In addition, I have put in a budget amendment for the Emergency Home and Accessibility Repair Program.&nbsp;This is similar to the tax credit but uses grants to help people with limited income.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Loud Vehicle Exhaust Systems</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2102" target="_blank">HB2102</a><span>&nbsp;deals with the issue of mufflers that have been purposefully altered to make our roads sound more like racetracks.&nbsp;These startle fellow motorists, rattle windows, and wake people up in the middle of the night.&nbsp;I even had a constituent email me at 2:00 in the morning because one of these vehicles woke up their infant.&nbsp;While I was pleased to be chief co-patron of legislation that reinstated the ability of police to pull these vehicles over, there is no way we will be able to ticket our way out of the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(42, 42, 42)">HB2102 would prohibit</span><span style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51)">&nbsp;the issuance of a safety inspection approval sticker on any vehicle equipped with these unlawful devices.&nbsp;To me, that is the fairest, most effective way to deal with the situation since you have a vehicle up the rack and a mechanic qualified to determine if the muffler has been illegally modified.&nbsp;Many thanks to Braddock Supervisor James Walkinshaw for testifying on behalf of the bill in subcommittee.</span></li></ul><span style="font-weight:bold">In addition to these bills, I have also introduced several budget amendments.&nbsp;</span><span>Highlights include the following.</span><br /><br /><span></span><ul style="color:rgb(64, 63, 66)"><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Chesapeake Bay Restoration</span><span>.&nbsp;I was pleased that the Governor&rsquo;s introduced budget includes significant funding for Chesapeake Bay restoration, including agricultural water quality best practices and wastewater treatment upgrades.&nbsp;This funding is essential for Virginia to meet a USEPA-mandated deadline to clean up the Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp;Missing, however, is funding to clean up polluted urban stormwater. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve introduced an amendment for $9.9M to the Stormwater Local Assistance Fund to rectify that situation!</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Housing Trust Fund</span><span>.&nbsp;The Housing Trust Fund is Virginia&rsquo;s most important funding source to promote affordable housing and leverage private funding.&nbsp;While it has grown significantly in the past few years, it is still very small compared to the need.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve introduced an amendment to increase the fund by $75M.&nbsp;According to the Virginia Housing Alliance, this investment will result in approximately 6,000 affordable homes being created or preserved.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Brain Injury Services</span><span>.&nbsp;Like many key public services, our brain injury service providers are struggling to attract and retain personnel.&nbsp;In Northern Virginia, salaries for those working in brain injury services are on average $10,000 less than jobs with comparable skill levels.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve introduced a $1M budget amendment to increase salaries so that we can attract and retain quality case managers and service providers.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">Teacher Mentoring and Retention</span><span>.&nbsp;Virginia faces a serious teacher shortage.&nbsp;According to a&nbsp;</span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt568.pdf" target="_blank">Virginia Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission report</a><span>, 10,900 teachers left in school year 2021/2022, while only 7,208 joined the profession. &nbsp;</span><a href="https://reachva.org/" target="_blank">REACH Virginia</a><span>&nbsp;is an innovative mentoring program designed to support new teachers and maximize the chance they will succeed in the long-term.&nbsp;Right now the program is only in Northern Virginia.&nbsp;My budget amendment ($630,000) will make the program more robust and expand it to serve teachers state-wide.</span></li></ul><span>You can see my full list of budget amendments&nbsp;</span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/mbramendment/2023/1/H177/" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span>&#8203;<br /><br /><span></span><span>Thank you to the many constituents who came down to Richmond this week to visit and advocate for a wide range of issues.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">It is an honor to serve you in the General Assembly!</span><br /><span></span></div>

font-weight:bold">the General Assembly made several changes to tax policy that will go into effect for Tax Year 2023</span><span style="color:black">.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black">Not too long ago, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Virginia had to cut its budget by $2.8 billion in the face of severe revenue shortfalls.&nbsp;Fortunately, our historically conservative budgeting process, in combination with a significant infusion of federal dollars, allowed us to weather the financial storm.&nbsp;Two years later, revenues are far outpacing forecasts &ndash; with FY2022 ending in a $2 billion surplus.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black">We do need to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves by creating new programs that can&rsquo;t be sustained in the long term or by over-cutting taxes in a way that structurally unbalances our budget.&nbsp;However, the situation presents a rare opportunity to make much needed structural adjustments to our tax system.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">It also comes at a time when Virginians are hurting with the impacts of high inflation.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black">In the end, I believe the General Assembly struck a good balance between one-time rebates (which do not create a long-term obligation) and changes to our tax system.&nbsp;Here is an overview of the major items.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">State Tax Rebate Checks</span><span style="color:black">.&nbsp;Everyone who paid state income taxes for Tax Year 2021 is eligible for a rebate check.&nbsp;Single filers will receive up to $250 and couples filing jointly will get up to $500.&nbsp;Checks will be distributed in October.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tax.virginia.gov/rebate" target="_blank">Click here for details</a><span style="color:black">.&nbsp; A rebate program provides the most flexibility since it can be used on gas, food, clothing, or any other items.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">Tax Policy Changes</span><span style="color:black">.&nbsp;In addition to one-time rebates, the General Assembly made several permanent changes to tax policy:</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><ul style="color:rgb(64, 63, 66)"><li style="color:black"><span>Increase the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">standard income tax deduction</span><span>&nbsp;from $4,500 to $8,000 for individuals and $9,000 to $16,000 for joint filers.&nbsp; Virginia's current deduction has not changed for many, many years.</span></li><li style="color:black"><span>Fully eliminate the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">state sales tax on food and personal hygiene products</span><span>&nbsp;effective January 1, 2023.</span></li><li style="color:black"><span>Provide a $40,000&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">subtraction for military retirement income</span><span>&nbsp;beginning at age 55.&nbsp;The full amount will be phased in over four years.</span></li><li style="color:black"><span>Establish a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">refundable earned income tax credit</span><span>&nbsp;at 15% of the federal level.&nbsp;The refundable EITC is specifically designed to help working families with low to moderate incomes.</span></li><li style="color:black"><span>Eliminate the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:bold">&ldquo;accelerated sales tax,"</span><span>&nbsp;an accounting sleight of hand implemented in tight budget years that required some Virginia businesses to pre-pay their sales tax in June (rather than July) of each year.</span></li></ul><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">In all, these changes are expected to reduce the average family&rsquo;s tax burden by more than $1,000 in Tax Year 2023.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black">In addition to tax reforms, we were able to make significant one-time expenditures to help ensure that our budget is structurally balanced and to address long-standing needs.&nbsp;This includes $750 million to stabilize the&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">Virginia Retirement System</span><span style="color:black">, $499 million to further bolster the&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">revenue stabilization fund</span><span style="color:black">, and $2.5 billion to implement previously authorized but unfunded&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">infrastructure improvements and deferred maintenance</span><span style="color:black">&nbsp;that otherwise would have been funded with debt.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><strong><span style="color:black">A Problem &ndash; Legislating Through the Budget</span></strong><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black">One of the things I love about Virginia&rsquo;s legislative process is the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitutionexpand/article4/#:~:text=No%20law%20shall%20embrace%20more,reenacted%20and%20published%20at%20length." target="_blank">&ldquo;one-object rule.&rdquo;</a><span style="color:black">&nbsp;This is enshrined in the Virginia Constitution and means that each bill can only address one issue.&nbsp;As a result, most bills are only a couple of paragraphs or pages long.&nbsp;The system creates transparency by ensuring legislators and voters know exactly what is being voted on.&nbsp;This makes us patently different than what happens in Washington, where massive omnibus bills are often the norm.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black">The budget is supposed to abide by this rule and deal only with appropriations-related items.&nbsp;That doesn&rsquo;t mean there isn&rsquo;t language directing how money should be used.&nbsp; That is totally appropriate.&nbsp;But it does mean we should avoid creating new laws through the budget bill.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black">While the General Assembly has not always lived up to the spirit of this rule, the most recent budget presents a caution flag that we need to take very seriously.&nbsp;As noted in this&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/vp-nw-government-statehouse-budget-20220722-r4so42vxfvcahmwaexgqxkyqqm-story.html" target="_blank">Virginian-Pilot article</a><span style="color:black">, the budget includes several items that should have been debated as separate bills.&nbsp;And in fact, some of them were debated &ndash; and defeated &ndash; during the regular session.&nbsp;This includes language on casinos, criminal justice reform, and marijuana possession &ndash; just to name a few.&nbsp;Since the final budget is negotiated by a conference committee and is an up-or-down vote, legislating through the budget means the public is denied an opportunity to weigh in.&nbsp; We need to do better in the future.</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><strong><span style="color:black">House and Senate Page Programs</span></strong><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">The House and Senate Page Programs are now accepting applications for the 2023 General Assembly session!</span><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:black">These are fantastic learning experiences where students have an opportunity to gain valuable civic and professional experience by working directly with legislators and legislative staff.&nbsp;Applicants must be 13 or 14 years old by January 11, 2023 and in good academic standing.&nbsp;The position is paid, and pages live in Richmond during session (they come home on weekends).&nbsp;The program ends with a mock session where pages introduce, debate, and vote on legislative initiatives on the House and Senate floors.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://capclass.virginiageneralassembly.gov/PagePrograms/PagePrograms.html" target="_blank">Click here for more information</a><span style="color:black">&nbsp;and let me know if I can answer any questions.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">It is an honor to serve you!</span><span style="color:black">&nbsp;Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me if I can be of assistance.</span></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight:bold">Goodbye 2022 regular session.&nbsp;Hello special session!&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>On Saturday, the General Assembly adjourned Sine Die &ndash; meaning the regular session is now over.&nbsp;While we were able to wrap up most of the legislative agenda, the FY2023-2024 budget is still a work in progress.&nbsp;Instead of extending the regular session, we will go back to Richmond once the conferees are able to come to final consensus.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold">Budget Status</span><br /><br /><span>The primary area of disagreement on the budget centers around the extent of tax reductions and rebates &ndash; the resolution of which will drive resources available to invest in K-12 education, higher education, teacher/state employee raises, school construction and modernization, transportation, health care, water quality, housing, and economic development.&nbsp;We also have the opportunity to significantly reduce unfunded liabilities to our Virginia Retirement System and stabilize the Virginia Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.&nbsp;All of this is set against the backdrop of whether the increases in revenue we are experiencing are short-term versus sustainable in the long-term.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Comparing versions of the budget (Governor versus House versus Senate) can be difficult since each (not surprisingly) is usually presented in the best or worst light possible.&nbsp;Thanks to the Commonwealth Institute for putting together this great&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Key-Budget-Policy-Choices-2022-committees.pdf" target="_blank">side-by-side comparison</a><span>&nbsp;of the competing budget policies that will be considered over the next couple of weeks.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold">Highlighted Issues &ndash; Facial Recognition, THC, and Charitable Gaming!</span><br /><br /><span>The last week of session is usually when the more complicated bills hit the House floor &ndash; since they take more time and effort to get through the legislative process.&nbsp;This year there were several bills fitting that profile.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Facial Recognition (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb741" target="_blank">SB741</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">)</span><span>.&nbsp;This bill sets the conditions under which law enforcement can use facial recognition technology.&nbsp;Facial recognition technology involves the use of algorithms to compare an individual&rsquo;s facial features against pictures aggregated from across a wide range of existing sources.&nbsp;The concept is very similar to technology used by many social media companies.&nbsp;While this can be a powerful tool to identify criminals as well as crime victims (such as victims of human trafficking), it is also an imperfect technology that can be abused without the right guardrails.&nbsp;Ultimately, I think we got it right by ensuring that there is always a human component before law enforcement can act on a potential match and by imposing very stiff penalties for misuse.&nbsp;The bill passed the House 54Y-42N and the Senate 27Y-13N with Democrats and Republicans splitting both ways.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Regulation of THC (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb591" target="_blank">SB591</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">)</span><span>.&nbsp;Throughout the debate on legalizing marijuana, there has been strong consensus on the need for consumer safety and keeping these products out of the hands of children.&nbsp;While THC is most often associated with marijuana, different variations can be produced synthetically, including hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD).&nbsp;One of these variations,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc" target="_blank">delta-8 THC</a><span>, has spread throughout Virginia and has resulted in an alarming spike in poison control calls and hospital visits.&nbsp;Because these products are not technically defined as marijuana, there are no age-restrictions, no labeling requirements, and no required third-party quality control testing.&nbsp;In response, SB591 shifts from regulating marijuana to regulating the amount of THC across the board. The legislation also prohibits THC products from being sold in forms that are attractive to children (such as animal or fruit shapes).&nbsp;Groups profiting from the current loophole worked very hard to kill the legislation.&nbsp;However, thanks to a fascinating coalition of the Virginia Farm Bureau, Family Foundation, Virginia Catholic Conference, and pro-legalization organizations such as NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) the bill passed and is on its way to the Governor&rsquo;s desk.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Charitable Gaming (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb763" target="_blank">HB763</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">)</span><span>.&nbsp;Charitable gaming sponsored by social and fraternal organizations has long played an important role in supporting community charities.&nbsp; The idea is that charitable gaming can occur in the social quarters of these organizations for the enjoyment of members and guests. Unfortunately, several unscrupulous organizations and manufacturers have taken advantage of a loophole that allows them to declare a local bar or similar area to be their &ldquo;social quarters&rdquo; and to set up in multiple locations. &nbsp;This has resulted in a proliferation of unregulated gaming that actually undercuts legitimate organizations.&nbsp;In response, the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.osig.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/office-of-the-state-inspector-general/pdf/2022-PA-001.pdf" target="_blank">Office of the State Inspector General</a><span>&nbsp;conducted a study to make recommendations for how to protect legitimate charities while reigning in those taking advantage of the loophole.&nbsp;Through many iterations (and much valued feedback from genuine charities) I supported the final legislation, which closes the loophole and increases enforcement at the state level.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold">My Legislation</span><br /><br /><span>Out of my 24 bills introduced, 14 made it through the Senate and are now awaiting action by the Governor.&nbsp;A couple of highlights include:</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Early Childhood Education Delivery (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB389" target="_blank">HB389</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">)</span><span>.&nbsp;This bill strengthens Virginia&rsquo;s early childhood education system by establishing regional entities to help parents better understand their options and connect providers to resources to help them improve overall quality.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Cocktails-to-Go (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB426" target="_blank">HB426</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">)</span><span>.&nbsp;This bill extends the ability of restaurants to provide cocktails-to-go, while also tightening up safety requirements designed to ensure that deliveries aren&rsquo;t made to underage customers.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Public Meetings for State Projects (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB437" target="_blank">HB437</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">)</span><span>.&nbsp;This bill ensures that large state capital projects take local concerns into consideration by requiring the state agency in charge of the project to have at least one public meeting at the request of the locality.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Campaign Finance Reform (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB492" target="_blank">HB492</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">)</span><span>.&nbsp;This bill enhances oversight of campaign finance disclosure requirements by requiring the Department of Elections to review a certain number of disclosure reports each election cycle.&nbsp;Currently, there is no review of these reports for accuracy after they are filed by a candidate.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Climate/Flood Resiliency (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB516" target="_blank">HB516</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1309" target="_blank">HB1309</a><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">)</span><span>.&nbsp;These bills expand and strengthen Virginia&rsquo;s resilience planning efforts and create a Resilient Virginia Revolving Loan Fund.&nbsp;Virginia is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</span><br /><br /><span>In addition, I am pleased that the Governor has signed into law my&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB473" target="_blank">HB473</a><span>.&nbsp;This bill was at the request of the&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">Virginia Retirement System</span><span>&nbsp;and is designed to make the system more efficient and provide employees with greater flexibility in how they invest their retirement funds.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold">Meeting with Your Organization</span><br /><br /><span>My most important job is to engage my constituents &ndash; both to ensure that they understand the issues being debated and to gather feedback to help inform my votes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(72, 161, 153); font-weight:bold">In that spirit, I would be pleased to speak at one of your community meetings or events</span><span>.&nbsp;My legislative assistant, Rama Van Pelt, is available during the week to help with scheduling.&nbsp;He can be reached at (703) 310-6752&nbsp;</span><span style="color:black">or&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:deldbulova@house.virginia.gov" target="_blank">deldbulova@house.virginia.gov</a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold">It is great to be home!&nbsp;Thank you for the opportunity to represent our community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
