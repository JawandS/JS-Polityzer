<h3><a href="/news/60th-march-on-washington">Commemorating 60th Anniversary of March on Washington</a></h3>
<p><p dir="ltr">60 years ago today, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. led the March on Washington. He stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and delivered his famous &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo; speech. But that cannot be the only lens through which we commemorate this historic event, especially as some seek to erase this history and obscure certain aspects of the people's movement for justice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take for instance the fact that the full title of the event was &ldquo;The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.&rdquo; While not often acknowledged, economic justice was at the forefront of both the march and King&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And further often left untold are the lesser-known excerpts from Dr. King&rsquo;s speech. Early in his remarks, King spoke about how the promise of the nation had continuously fallen short for Black and Brown Americans: &ldquo;It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus Elects&nbsp;Del. Cia Price as Vice Chair</h1>
</div>
<strong>RICHMOND, Virginia</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; This Wednesday, the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus (VLBC) elected Del. Cia Price (D-95, Newport News) to serve as Vice-Chair. She is filling the unexpired term left vacant when Rep. Jennifer McClellan was elected to Congress. Price has served in the House of Delegates since 2016 and has previously served as Chaplain and Secretary of the VLBC. She has worked diligently on voting rights and was the lead sponsor of the Voting Rights Act of Virginia; in addition, she has worked on housing justice and many of the VLBC's other legislative priorities.<br />
<br />
Senator Lamont Bagby, Chairman of the VLBC, said, "The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus unanimously elected my good friend Del. Cia Price as Vice Chair, and I couldn't be happier." He continued, "Cia is someone we can count on. From her constituents back home in Newport News, to the VLBC members who stand shoulder to shoulder in so many important fights, to people all across the Commonwealth looking for bold leadership: I can say unequivocally that our new Vice Chair has our backs. I look forward to working with her in this new role as our Caucus continues to build the kind of leadership team every Virginian deserves."<br />
<br />
"I am honored and humbled by the trust my colleagues have put in me. I look forward to continuing the legacy of those who have held this position before me," said Del. Cia Price. She also said, "This caucus has worked for generations to amplify the voices of those who are too often otherwise disregarded. As Vice Chair of the VLBC, I look forward to using this new platform to be an even stronger advocate for those Virginians who are counting on us to deliver on their behalf. We will not let extremists erase our history or distract us from getting needed equity. Together, we stand firm in our refusal to turn back the clock."<br />
<br />

<p><div>
<p>House Bill 1650, sponsored by&nbsp;<a href="https://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/members/members.php?id=H0284" target="_blank">Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News</a>, which would have empowered local governments to seek court orders directing landlords to fix uninhabitable dwellings, died in the House General Laws Committee with no debate. It passed out of the committee last year with the support of 11 of 12 Republican members, and this year&rsquo;s version was approved in a gatekeeper subcommittee with the support of one member, Del. Emily Brewer, R-Isle of Wight, who voted to kill the measure when it came before the full committee. Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield voted for it in both the subcommittee and the committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the bill died, Price fired back, saying House Republicans &ldquo;have lost touch with residents so much so that they cannot even bring themselves to support legislation in 2023 that they supported in 2022... MAGA Republicans made it clear that they would rather protect wealthy slumlords over renters in desperate need of healthy and safe homes.&rdquo;</p>

                        <strong>RICHMOND, VA</strong>- Today, Delegate Marcia &ldquo;Cia&rdquo; Price, who represents the 95th District in the House of Delegates, released the following statement about Republicans in the General Laws Committee defeating HB 1650, which would have allowed localities to hold absentee landlords legally accountable:
                        <p dir="ltr" data-ogsc="rgb(117, 117, 117)">"It is unfortunate that MAGA Republicans in the House of Delegates have lost touch with residents so much so that they cannot even bring themselves to support legislation in 2023 that they supported in 2022.</p>
                        <p dir="ltr" data-ogsc="rgb(117, 117, 117)">HB1650 was in direct response to constituent concerns and lived experience with unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. There are slumlords here in the Commonwealth who refuse to make necessary improvements and repairs for their renters&rsquo; health and safety. MAGA Republicans made it clear that they would rather protect wealthy slumlords over renters in desperate need of healthy and safe homes.</p>
                        <p dir="ltr" data-ogsc="rgb(117, 117, 117)">Despite the moral and political failings of my Republican colleagues, I will not back down from this fight.

<p><div data-qa="article-body">
<p data-qa="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text">Del. Marcia S. &ldquo;Cia&rdquo; Price (D-Newport News) responded in her own speech that she was &ldquo;very encouraged&rdquo; to hear a Republican talking about school safety and voicing support for teachers, after recent political efforts to blame teachers for school shutdowns during the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_19" target="_blank">coronavirus</a>&nbsp;pandemic and to position them as opponents of the interests of parents. &ldquo;I ask that we stop talking about teachers in dehumanizing ways,&rdquo; Price said. &ldquo;I ask that we stop denigrating them in order to feed our campaign slogans and actually work together as teachers, parents, children and community members.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-qa="drop-cap-letter" data-el="text">Most important, Price said, is that &ldquo;the pain my city is going through &hellip; not be used for political points.&rdquo; But she said Ransone&rsquo;s comments could open the door &ldquo;to finally have a conversation about guns in our communities.&rdquo; &ldquo;When you talk about gun violence and you talk about Hampton Roads and some of the things the schools are going through, they shy away from the conversation because then they would actually have to talk about the guns, and that&rsquo;s not fodder for their base,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><p>RICHMOND, Va. (WSET) &mdash;&nbsp;Democrats in the House of Delegates introduced the 17 bills they submitted regarding gun violence prevention. Some big items in this bundle include raising the age of purchase to 21 years old and restricting the sale of assault firearms, large-capacity magazines, and silencers.</p>
<p>Delegate Marcia Price (D) is one of the five lawmakers making this push for reform. She thinks that reform is something both Democrats and Republicans can agree on in order to make our communities safer.</p>
<p>Price's contribution to this bundle is a proposal for a two-year study by the JLARC (Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission) on the social, physical, emotional, and economic effects of gun violence on communities across the Commonwealth. This is just one piece of what she thinks is a comprehensive group that encompasses the various issues involved in the gun violence epidemic. "In order to combat a comprehensive problem, we have to come to the table with comprehensive solutions, and that's what I think you see with the agenda that we've put forward. They're common sense. They're also evidence-based," said Price.</p></p>

<p>This is the second year Price has advanced the bill, which passed&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB802" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB802" target="_blank">both the House and the Senate</a>&nbsp;last year before being&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/youngkin-only-vetoes-democratic-led-bills/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/youngkin-only-vetoes-democratic-led-bills/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vetoed by Governor Glenn Youngkin</a>. In his veto release, he said, &ldquo;It is neither clear why this language is necessary to enforce already existing provisions of state law, nor what the additional language contained in the legislation seeks to accomplish beyond what is already authorized in the USBC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That prompted a question from Delegate Roxann Robinson (R &ndash; Chesterfield), a member of the committee, &ldquo;What was changed that this bill has a better chance of success?&rdquo; Price replied that the veto likely stemmed from a lack of communication between herself and the Youngkin administration, causing them to confuse the fire code &mdash; which can already be enforced by localities &mdash; with the building code or USBC, which currently can&rsquo;t. &ldquo;What I think happened, was there was a conflation between what can happen under violations of the fire code versus what can happen under violations of the [USBC],&rdquo; Price said. &ldquo;For the building code, for the things that are hazardous to health this power does not exist.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p>&ldquo;My ask is simple: I ask you cast the same vote you did last year to protect the families that are in need of help," Del. Marcia Price told a General Laws subcommittee Thursday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price (D--Dist. 95) introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1650" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">House Bill 1650&nbsp;</a>in subcommittee hearings on the second day of Virginia's lawmaking session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill, if passed, is a tenants rights package that would hold landlords more accountable through the court system in the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it becomes a law, city governments would gain the power to go to court and force a landlord to make needed repairs to their buildings through a judge&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s identical to a bill Price introduced last year, which made it all the way to the governor's desk before ultimately getting vetoed.</p>
<p>Now, Price can point to the months-long Seaview Lofts saga as evidence of why the bill is needed....</p>
<p>On a 5-3 vote, Price's bill made it out of the subcommittee stage and will now move to review before a full General Rules Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>So far, it has written support by more than 50 organizations in Virginia, including the Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.</p></p>

<p><p>More ambitious proposals came from Delegates Marcia Price (D &ndash; Newport News) and David Bulova (D &ndash; Fairfax), including&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1652" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1652" target="_blank">an increase in the grace period</a>&nbsp;for late rent and permission for tenants to immediately break leases when they move in and&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1635" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find the unit uninhabitable</a>.

<p>Bulova said his proposal was formulated with help from the Virginia Poverty Law Center and that it should be considered the equivalent of &ldquo;lemon laws&rdquo; for cars. &ldquo;If the unit doesn&rsquo;t meet these basic standards, then the person should be able to get out of the lease and get their deposit back without having to go through an expensive legal process,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Price proposed a slate of three bills, one of which grants localities the right to enforce rental agreements on landlords when poor conditions present &ldquo;a fire hazard or serious threat to the life, health, or safety of tenants.&rdquo; &ldquo;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1650" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1650" target="_blank">This bill</a>&nbsp;would allow for localities to sue the landlords for the actual fixes needed to the property and get justice for the tenant,&rdquo; Price wrote. The slate of proposals will likely face an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates.</p>

<h3><a href="/news/opinion-accountability-needed-for-virginia-election-problems-prices-op-ed">Opinion: Accountability needed for Virginia election problems (Price's Op Ed)</a></h3>
<p><p>The elections process in Virginia is now more accessible to voters than ever before thanks to the work Democrats did in 2020. Turnout in the November elections set records for midterm elections thanks to the easy access to the voting booth activists worked to achieve. Our work led to Virginia moving from being ranked 49th to 11th in a ranking of states that make voting accessible. We&rsquo;ve worked hard to ensure that everyone who wants to make their voice heard in our elections has not only the right to do so, but the ability and access to make it happen.</p>
<p>But our democracy is under attack, even here in Virginia. We&rsquo;ve been through so much, just trying to put one foot in front of the other. We&rsquo;ve pushed, we&rsquo;ve rallied, we&rsquo;ve survived against all odds, and now, once again, we&rsquo;re under attack with zero accountability to uphold the very thing that so many have died to defend. Republicans such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares don&rsquo;t share our excitement for making voting more accessible to everyone. In fact, they are doing everything they can to halt our progress, make voting more difficult than ever, and to put up purposeful barriers to voting in the hopes that it will help them cling on to power.</p>

<p>Leading up to Election Day, a delay in voter registration processing resulted in more than 250,000 voter registration applications being dumped on local registrars for processing with very little time before Election Day. It was only thanks to local registrars and their staff working overtime that Election Day went as smoothly as it did. Despite her department&rsquo;s massive error, Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals, a hyper-partisan who once worked for election denier and insurrectionist state Sen. Amanda Chase, is trying to blame the error on Democrats for making voting more accessible for everyone instead of on her failure to run a successful Department of Elections.</p>
<p>In addition to the problems processing voter registration applications, the Department of Elections mailed incorrect information about voting to more than 30,000 voters. It&rsquo;s unclear how many voters this mistake disenfranchised, but the number is not zero. Incompetence like this that leads to voters being unable to make their voice heard in our elections is unacceptable. We must come together to hold the Department of Elections accountable for their mistakes and ensure that no other voters are prevented from casting their ballots by misinformation and incompetence.</p>
<div id="nativo_936350">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Lastly, Virginia has a new vendor to replace the VERIS system. It takes time and patience to build out an election system that works for everyone in the commonwealth, and yet Beale&rsquo;s office recklessly sat on the new contract for months, leaving the general public out of the loop on our new system, a timeline for launch, and other details needed. Then, after it was finally announced, the contract includes a much longer initial build out phase and longer term maintenance period. The public deserves transparency and accountability in its voting systems and how elections are run in Virginia.</p>
<p>We cannot and will not accept attacks on our right to vote. I&rsquo;m calling on Youngkin to hold Beals accountable, to make a commitment to the voters of Virginia to get the Department of Elections back on track, and to ensure that every single voter who wants to vote in our elections has the ability to do so. With the entire House of Delegates and state Senate of Virginia on the ballot next year in addition to local races, we need to correct these mistakes and head into next year&rsquo;s election season with confidence that our Department of Elections knows what they are doing.</p>

<p><p>Making Virginia&rsquo;s version of the credit refundable, a change done through the new state budget, means that instead of only reducing how much a low-income tax filer owes without giving money back, it can now lead to a bigger refund &mdash; or create a refund that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has an outsized impact on the families that need the most help,&rdquo; Kenneth said. She added that help for those on the lower end will bring some balance to a &ldquo;regressive&rdquo; state system that taxes all income above $17,000 at the same rate.</p>
<p>Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, pointed to several factors to explain the breakthrough on EITC refundability: the work of those who have championed it for years, Senate Democrats &ldquo;digging their heels in&rdquo; during budget negotiations and a broad recognition that the COVID-19 crisis hit the poor harder than the wealthy. &ldquo;The pandemic just had a way of exposing things in a new light,&rdquo; said Price, one of several lawmakers who sponsored EITC legislation last session.</p>
<p>In the past, the EITC concept has drawn support from across the ideological spectrum because it&rsquo;s a pro-work incentive targeted largely toward people with children. It&rsquo;s often compared to free-market economist Milton Friedman&rsquo;s proposal for a &ldquo;negative income tax,&rdquo; an anti-poverty idea he said would be more efficient than government aid programs by giving cash directly to lower-income people and letting them use it however they see fit.</p></p>

<p><div>
<p>This week, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle from Hampton Roads weighed in on the controversial conversation surrounding abortion access and its future in Virginia. Wednesday, state legislators reconvened in Richmond for a special session of the Virginia General Assembly. After the bipartisan pleasantries, delegates from the region soon took the microphone, some to speak out against Gov. Glenn Youngkin, more specifically his pro-life stance.</p>
<p>"Decisions like this belong to a woman and her doctor, not the governor," Minority Leader and Portsmouth Del. Don Scott said. Scott argued that the governor's views on the issue are out of touch with the rest of Virginia.&nbsp; "The reality is that more than half of the state after the Dobbs decision was afraid that the governor and Republicans would try to come in today and ban abortions -- try to limit a woman&rsquo;s reproductive freedoms," Del. Scott said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Protecting life is not what we saw this past legislative session. We saw an extremist agenda more interested in retweets and revenge than protecting constituents' lives. We&rsquo;ve heard promises to send down a bill to ban abortion and restrict Virginians' freedoms by taking power away from individuals to make decisions about their own health," Newport News Del. Marcia Price said shortly after.</p>

<p><p>Gov. Glenn Youngkin is facing calls to withdraw his recent appointee to the Historic Resources Board due to her recent comments defending the Confederacy and criticizing former President Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s role in the Civil War.&nbsp; Youngkin announced last week he had appointed Ann McLean, a historian and the founder of a Christian school in Richmond, to serve on the Board of Historic Resources. Shortly after, she came under fire for previous remarks defending Confederate statues on a Richmond radio show. On Monday, she returned to the radio show and seemingly doubled down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the appropriate reaction here is disgust,&rdquo; Del. Cia Price, a Newport News Democrat and member of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, said Tuesday.</p></p>

<p><p>Domestic workers are excluded from American labor laws by design. Congress left out domestic workers from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to appease white Southern lawmakers who wanted to maintain free and cheap labor, provided primarily by women of color. To this day, this country does not guarantee a minimum wage or overtime pay to these essential workers. To keep these Jim Crow laws on the books is to support racist policies and reinforce workplace oppression.</p>
<p>This work is personal. We come from families of care workers who did not have the protections they deserved. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re pushing back against that painful and too-often ignored history. Last year, Care in Action worked with domestic workers and sponsors Del. Cia Price, Del. Wendy Gooditis, and state Sen. Jennifer McClellan to pass a Virginia Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. This historic legislation extends common workplace rights to house cleaners, health care aides and nannies. Virginia is the first state in the South to codify protections for these workers and finally turn the page on this ugly chapter from our past.</p>
<p>While passage of these laws is essential and long overdue, we can&rsquo;t help but wonder: How long will it take for the rest of the country to catch up? Progress doesn&rsquo;t have to be a painful, drawn-out process. Swift federal action can protect all workers across the nation.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>NEWPORT NEWS, VA</strong> - <em>Delegate Marcia "Cia" Price issued the following statement in reaction to the devastating Supreme Court&nbsp;</em><em>decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization&nbsp;</em><em>to overturn decades of precedent regarding a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">"There's no excuse.&nbsp;A tarnished court this flippant with both the law and lives has lost all credibility, and today's disastrous ruling only serves to undermine further the very protections they are duty-bound to uphold. And if that wasn't enough, the court signaled its next targets: contraception, consensual sex between adults, and marriage equality. All are on the chopping block, and it is clear that after today's ruling, we cannot and should not trust this failed institution to safeguard our rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"But as some of its most conservative members made clear, the game was rigged from the get-go. The court established for itself a single, myopic barometer. And when official decisions can only be influenced by the thinking prevalent when old, white, land-owning men had a singular say in public affairs, we are destined to regress as a nation and fall even further, with civil rights eroded and Black and Brown communities once again bearing the brunt of a system designed to crush those most in need.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">"The unfortunate reality is that all of this was accomplished under the false banner of "pro-life." But there is nothing "pro-life" about today's ruling. In fact, that term is rendered meaningless without programs, funding, and resources in place to support those lives. Many individuals self-applying that title are also the same folks who will vote against maternal health initiatives, public school funding, pre-K expansion, after-school programs, free lunch, childcare, and affordable housing without batting an eye. They are the same folks who were quick to yell &ldquo;my body, my choice&rdquo; about life-saving vaccinations during the pandemic but are so entrenched in their own power grabs, they do not acknowledge the depths of their hypocrisy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">"I know today is tough, and honestly, it may get worse before it gets better. But we can not give up on this fight.&nbsp; Thank you to the advocates, activists, volunteers, healthcare providers, lawyers and so many others who have been on the front lines of this fight. We see you, we appreciate you, and we stand with you. You can support their efforts by signing up to volunteer and donating to these organizations:</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>NEWPORT NEWS, VA </strong>- <em>Delegate Marcia &ldquo;Cia&rdquo; Price, who represents the 95th District in the Virginia House of Delegates, was recently given&nbsp;the Jack Brooks Leadership Award for her efforts to secure access to the ballot box by fighting to pass the Voting Rights Act of Virginia.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The first of its kind in the South, and in the face of threats to the nation&rsquo;s democracy, the Voting Rights Act of Virginia codified essential voter protections, outlawed voter intimidation and discrimination, and addressed the ongoing attempts to silence the electoral voice of Virginia&rsquo;s Black communities and communities of color.</em><br />
<br />
"I am humbled to receive the Jack Brooks Leadership Award for championing the ground-breaking Voting Rights Act of Virginia. Modeled after the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, this historic legislation addresses the very real and imminent efforts to undermine our democracy. Through this law, we provide essential protections against voter discrimination and reverse many of the wrongs Virginia's Black and Brown communities have endured as obstacles to voting. I worked alongside Sen. McClellan to safeguard this fundamental right; a right that ensures all other rights and which so many in my community still have painful memories of being denied. And even as we celebrate this win, we must remain committed to fighting ongoing voter suppression in all its forms,&rdquo; said Delegate Price.<br />
<br />
Jeb Brooks, Chairman of the Jack Brooks Foundation Board of Directors and son of the late Congressman Jack Brooks, added, &ldquo;The Jack Brooks Foundation is thrilled to honor Delegate Marcia &ldquo;Cia&rdquo; Price with the Jack Brooks Award this year. Delegate Price&rsquo;s leadership in passing the Virginia Voting Rights Act was truly extraordinary and deserving of the highest praise. Her actions represent a shining example for elected officials across the country who are committed to ensuring that all Americans have an opportunity to fully participate in the electoral process.&rdquo;<br />

<h3><a href="/news/del-prices-statement-on-the-governors-budget-amendments">Del. Price's Statement on the Governor's Budget Amendments</a></h3>
<p><p dir="ltr">June 20, 2022</p>
<p dir="ltr">NEWPORT NEWS, VA - Friday, we gathered for a special session in Richmond to consider the Governor's budget amendments, and something became apparent right away: he just doesn't get it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just when we thought the Governor's legislative agenda couldn't have been worse for Virginia residents, his amendments doubled down on his "politics before people" agenda. I voted against the compromise budget as initially introduced, voicing concerns about investments aimed more at shutting down critics than serving Virginians and a lack of transparency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In just a few weeks' time, the Governor took that imperfect budget and made it worse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His proposed changes not only reflected bad policy, but they were also clearly targeted at attacking his critics; choices focused not on improving lives but on taking jabs at those who have voiced concern about his Administration's priorities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Look no further than how communities of color were treated in the budget.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Money set aside to support Virginia's DREAMers was instead moved to fund HBCUs. This decision intentionally tries to place communities of color at odds with each other without helping either. And unfortunately, some fell for this move straight out of the Jim Crow playbook.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This was a totally unnecessary choice because, with historic revenues, we had enough to fund both.&nbsp; It's a cynical move and just one more example of the vindictive thinking at the heart of these disastrous amendments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Governor clearly doesn't get it, but House Democrats do. That's why we stood up to protect life-saving reproductive healthcare the Governor tried to strip away. And that&rsquo;s why we fought against the Governor&rsquo;s hyperpartisan agenda so we could better fund our schools and protect our communities from gun violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It's clear that the Governor is perfectly comfortable using the budget to legislate; embedding failed policies in state spending that he couldn't get passed through the General Assembly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why else delay criminal justice reforms? Why try to sneak in provisions to defund public schools for unvetted, private pet projects? Why seek to silence free speech by making it harder to protest? Why seek to put even more money in the pockets of oil industry executives instead of everyday Virginians?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Because the name of the game here isn't to serve the people; it's to settle scores. It isn't to do right by the residents of Virginia, it's to do right by the hosts of Fox News.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The people of the Commonwealth deserve a budget that reflects their values, and that's exactly what House Democrats were fighting for this whole session. And while we stood firm in those values, the politics let the people down as efforts to undermine public education succeeded. And the General Assembly broke a promise to 500 families with incarcerated loved ones who had been told they would be going home next month.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We can&rsquo;t continue to let politics win over helping people&nbsp; We have so much more to do, and we have to stay ever ready for their next push to further harm those in need while increasing the wealth of those in power.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I refuse to be quiet. Let's keep making noise together.</p>

<h3><a href="/news/del-prices-statement-on-the-budget">Del. Price's Statement on the Budget</a></h3>
<p><p dir="ltr"><em>Today, Delegate Marcia "Cia" Price released the following statement about the 2022 budget conference report:</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">"There is a lot in this budget conference report we Democrats fought for and accomplished on behalf of the people of Virginia. From tax relief for all to long-awaited raises for teachers, from much-needed investments in our schools to early childhood education and more, this conference report reflects how hard we fought against a unified opposition more interested in making headlines than making policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let me be clear: my dissent is not based on the investments this budget makes, but instead with what it leaves out; with who it overlooks and who it leaves behind.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The conference report reflects the cynical opportunism from too many of my colleagues from across the aisle. You will no doubt hear from them about the investments contained within the report. What you won't hear is how Democrats fought tooth and nail to get many of those investments included. You will no doubt hear from them about these "common-sense," "bipartisan" measures. What you won't hear is how Republicans pushed for bare-minimum investments; not to improve lives, but to silence critics. And you won&rsquo;t hear them talk about the secretive budget process, which lacked transparency and ignored public input.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even when it became apparent that the Commonwealth had historic funding available (far more than was expected when the budget was first introduced) Republicans still chose to cut critical funding for gun violence prevention and affordable housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We had the opportunity to forge a path that others could follow. During this difficult and painful moment, we could have once again led the way on innovative approaches to combating gun violence and saving lives. And instead, we slashed funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The uncomfortable truth is that the same funding you will hear Republicans tout doesn't actually address the problems facing Virginians or chip away at the long-standing issues that too many in leadership have refused to address. They're band-aids; minimal increases that look good as fundraising emails but don't impact futures or transform communities. We Democrats are proud to have fought for each and every dollar that will go to a Virginian in need. But it's not enough, and the other side knows it. That money is there to keep us quiet, not make things better, and I for one refuse to be quiet.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For these reasons, I voted no on HB30. Instead, I vow to raise my voice in favor of a bold state budget that truly represents our values and adequately meets the needs of our residents."</p></p>

<p><p>These statistics are jarring. But these are not just statistics; each number represents a personal tragedy: mothers, fathers, sons and daughters whose lives were cut short due to gun violence.

<p><p>"No one should be sitting there that long without hot water and being made to live in those conditions. That's something that needs to be fixed," Allman said. Currently, if someone complains to their local government about a property, they can come and inspect it. If they find code violations, they can issue fines or even condemn buildings, but often times Price says it's cheaper for landlords to pay a fine instead of fixing the problem.</p>
<p>"Let's say for instance you have this situation where the cost of repairs is $3,000, but the fine is $100. If you only have $100, your landlord is going to pay the fine and it doesn't incentivize you to fix the issue," Price said. State lawmakers passed the bill that would've added teeth to what local governments could do, but Gov. Youngkin vetoed the bill, saying it wasn't necessary.</p></p>

<h3><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/republican-lawmakers-abandon-support-bills-210500668.html" target="_blank">Republican lawmakers abandon support for bills from Dems after Youngkin vetoes</a></h3>
<p><p>Republican legislators bailed in their support of bipartisan legislation and instead voted this week to uphold Gov. Glenn Youngkin&rsquo;s vetoes on 26 bills that had been introduced by Democrats.&nbsp;Three bills from delegates in Hampton Roads were among those vetoed. One was a measure from Portsmouth Democrat Nadarius Clark that would have set a three-year statute of limitations on medical debt. Two others came from Newport News Democrat Cia Price, including one that would have given localities the authority to sue negligent landlords over matters that endanger tenants&rsquo; health.</p>
<p>In a statement to The Virginian-Pilot, Price said she would not be discouraged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed but undaunted,&rdquo; she wrote on Thursday. &ldquo;We have to keep fighting for the working families that need us the most.&rdquo; In a heated speech Wednesday from the House floor, Price questioned why the governor vetoed a bill that received wide support. The measure was endorsed by the city of Newport News, Virginia Poverty Law Center and the Virginia Apartment and Management Association, which represents more than 230,000 rental units across the state. &ldquo;We worked diligently with stakeholders that are often on opposite sides of housing issues,&rdquo; she told fellow lawmakers. &ldquo;We had support from those that were advocating for landlords and for tenants, and we had votes from both Republicans and Democrats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor&rsquo;s veto, Price said, chose &ldquo;rats, mice, roaches, leaky roofs, mold, mildew, broken doors and dangerous playground equipment over kids&rsquo; ability to be safe in their homes.&rdquo;</p></p>

The disguising conditions described by a tenant of a Newport News apartment were a sample of conditions targeted by the bill that had support of many groups, including the city of Newport News and the Virginia Apartment Management Association.</p>
<p>In the second article about Gov. Glenn Youngkin&rsquo;s veto, Youngkin said in a statement, &ldquo;My goal as governor is to make Virginia the best place to live, work, and raise a family and the bills I vetoed today reaffirm that commitment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editorial was about Youngkin signing a bill to protect dogs. The Editorial Board stated, &ldquo;it is reassuring whenever lawmakers recognize an egregious problem and move swiftly, together, to address it thoughtfully.&rdquo;</p>

<div>The tenant who shared her story said it best, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to be a voice for everybody who may be scared to say stuff. ... You shouldn&rsquo;t treat somebody like this.&rdquo; State leaders should be given a second chance. Del. Cia Price could reintroduce her bill, have the House pass it, and have the governor sign it reaffirming his commitment by correcting his egregious error.</div>

After too many&nbsp;<a href="https://vpm.org/news/articles/31445/youngkin-vetoes-bipartisan-bill-designed-to-rein-in-slumlords">horror stories about slumlords</a>, policymakers in the commonwealth came up with a solution that was backed by both the Virginia Poverty Law Center and the Virginia Apartment and Management Association. By all appearances, it was a reform package that would benefit many Virginians. Even 16 Republican lawmakers in Richmond voted with Democrats to advance the legislation. But as the local NPR affiliate&nbsp;<a href="https://vpm.org/news/articles/31445/youngkin-vetoes-bipartisan-bill-designed-to-rein-in-slumlords">reported</a>, the bill was nevertheless vetoed by Republican Gov.

<div>This epidemic impacts how students learn, how residents live, how businesses invest, and how communities view themselves. And we owe it to these communities, who are disproportionately impacted by gun violence, to hear their voices and take action. That's why, during the regular session earlier this year, we introduced legislation aimed at addressing gun violence by establishing Virginia's first Firearm Violence Prevention Center (<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb487">SB 487</a>/<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb825">HB 825</a>).</div>

<p><p>The horror stories have cropped up from tenants across the state: no heat, holes in the walls, rotten floors and flooded kitchens. In cases ranging from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/henrico-county/hundreds-of-violations-found-in-henricos-glenwood-farms-in-4-year-span-its-unacceptable/" target="_blank">Glenwood Farms</a>&nbsp;in Henrico to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/newport-news/aqua-vista-apartments-in-newport-news-slapped-with-300-violations/291-96bce655-2978-4a77-94fc-c63c8f957e3c" target="_blank">Aqua Vista</a>&nbsp;in Newport News, residents&rsquo; complaints have continued even after property owners have been slapped with hundreds of code citations.</p>
<p>Housing advocates say legislation passed by the General Assembly on a bipartisan vote would have helped rein in the most negligent landlords. Now they&rsquo;re questioning Gov. Glenn Youngkin&rsquo;s veto of the&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB802" target="_blank">bill</a>&nbsp;from Del. Cia Price (D-Newport News), which received no critical testimony in committee and was backed by both the Virginia Poverty Law Center and the Virginia Apartment and Management Association.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is creating a safe space in Virginia for slumlords,&rdquo; Price says. &ldquo;I don't know what the governor was thinking but that's what the end result will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Part of the problem now is that cities and counties don&rsquo;t have great tools at their disposal to deal with absentee landlords, according to Christie Marra, director of housing advocacy at the VPLC. Their main mode of enforcement is citing landlords for code violations, which, if they don&rsquo;t address, can result in fines as low as $50.</p></p>

<p><p>Governor Glenn Youngkin has vetoed 26 bills lawmakers put on his desk this year. One of those vetoes was for a bill aimed at cracking down on slumlords.&nbsp; Mold. Rats. Bad plumbing. Sewage. Christie Marra at the Virginia Poverty Law Center says she's heard from renters across Virginia who have raised concerns about all of these problems and more. She says local governments have limited authority to crack down on slumlords, essentially charging them with a small fine and that's about it. That's why she was working with lawmakers on a bill to give local governments enforcement authority to fix problems. "And that requires the landlord to come into court and explain why he didn't do it," Marra says. "And if he doesn't have a good reason for not doing it he can be held in civil contempt of court and that can send him to jail."</p>
<p>The bill was introduced by Delegate Cia Price, a Democrat from Newport News. She was able to get the bill out of the House and Senate with bipartisan majorities. But the governor vetoed her bill this week. Price says lawmakers have the power to override that veto.&nbsp; "Between now and veto session, every resident of Virginia has the right and I think responsibility to reach out to their legislator to tell them what it is they would want to see done," Price says. "And I really think that people understand slumlords and shady contracts should not have a harbor within Virginia."</p></p>

<p><strong>Delegate Marcia "Cia" Price Releases Statement Regarding Governor's Veto of HB 802, HB 1298</strong></p>
<p>Today, Del. Marcia "Cia" Price released the following statement regarding the Governor's veto of HB 802 and HB 1298:</p>
<p>"It is both unfortunate and revealing that the Governor chose to veto good bills from the recent General Assembly Session, including two bills I championed. Both bills addressed issues raised by constituents of the 95th District, and both had very specific aims: to protect everyday people from exploitation.</p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb802">HB 802</a> focused on renters and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1298">HB 1298</a> focused on high school student athletes, but the Governor's vetoes amount to the same thing: fewer protections for Virginians in need and more opportunities for the powerful to take advantage of those who are asking for help. These bills weren't partisan solutions; they are common-sense solutions, and I had hoped the positive impact they would have had on real Virginians would have overcome short-sighted politics.</p>
<p>Today, I am even more energized to fight for change. I will continue to work to protect and help the residents of the 95th District who I am ao honored to represent."</p></p>

<p><p>Three of the rejected bills were from legislators in Hampton Roads, including a housing bill from Newport News Democrat Cia Price that would have given localities the authority to sue negligent landlords over matters that endanger tenants&rsquo; health. In Youngkin&rsquo;s explanation, he wrote that the bill included &ldquo;unnecessary and duplicative provisions&rdquo; that were already established under the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. Price said she was confused by his explanation, as judges and lawyers she&rsquo;s spoken to say that isn&rsquo;t the case. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to get to the bottom of that,&rdquo; she said. Noting that she&rsquo;s been outspoken on civil rights issues, Price said it was &ldquo;very possible&rdquo; the governor targeted her bill. But she said she couldn&rsquo;t be sure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the position where I would have benefited from this, I am in the position where I represent a ton of people who could have,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So (he) still didn&rsquo;t succeed, if it was a personal attack.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Del. Cia Price, who introduced the bill, said she worked on the measure after hearing from constituents who couldn&rsquo;t get landlords to fix a range of problems, including mold, leaks, rodent infestations and broken heat or air conditioning.</p>
<div id="outstream_2_wrapper">
<div>
<div>&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really heart-breaking because when I would go into their apartments and meet with them &mdash; a lot of the kids who live in these apartments have respiratory issues,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;...

</div>
</div>
<p>But the Newport News Democrat said localities have limited options when it comes to taking action against landlords; they can either issue fines or condemn the buildings.</p>
<p>Fines aren&rsquo;t always effective because they can often be less costly than large-scale improvements, Price said. And condemning buildings can exacerbate problems with housing shortages or homelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bill would allow them to sue to get the actual things fixed, not just give a fine or condemn the apartment,&rdquo; she said.</p></p>

<p><p>Del. Cia Price is all too familiar with the cost of gun violence. The Newport News Democrat said she receives a steady stream of letters and visits from constituents whose loves ones died from gun-related injuries. 'There are certain visuals I will never be able to get out of my head &mdash; mothers and fathers weeping at having lost their children,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;... It&rsquo;s sad, it&rsquo;s scary and we need long-term sustainable change.&rdquo; Communities throughout Virginia are grappling with rising gun violence. And Hampton Roads is in the thick of it; local leaders met up last week to discuss potential solutions after 16 people were shot, four fatally, during an especially violent weekend in March.</p>
<p>But state legislators,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>too, are looking at ways to reduce gun violence. Two bills addressing the issue, one in the Senate and the other in the House, are under negotiation in a conference committee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s completely rocking certain communities across the commonwealth,&rdquo; Price said. &ldquo;... You have to wonder where we could be today if for the last three decades we had taken this seriously. My heart hurts about that, but I&rsquo;m ready to do something so that 30 years from now we are not in that same position.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p>Under Price&rsquo;s proposal, localities will be allowed to step in on behalf of tenants to seek an injunction against a landlord with proven building code violations and ask for damages. Once the court is involved, judges can order landlords to make necessary fixes, repay tenants for repairs they undertake themselves or waive a portion of their monthly rent as compensation for the hazardous conditions.</p>
<p>The bill is only designed to hold landlords accountable for safety and health standards, so apartment managers who don&rsquo;t keep the gym equipment, pool, or other amenities up to their tenants&rsquo; liking are exempt. The narrowly tailored nature of the bill is partly what earned HB802 the backing of the Virginia Apartment and Management Association and the Apartment &amp; Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington.</p>

<p><p>Although the bill passed with bipartisan support, many Democrats still strongly oppose the measure. Del. Marcia Price, a Democrat who represents Newport News and Hampton, calls this bill an overstep of state power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking the decisions out of the hands of those that were elected at the local level to make those decisions, I think is an overreach of our power,&rdquo; said Price. &ldquo;I just really hope that they got their calculations right that this will not be putting actual lives at risk but my fear is that it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sen. Lionell Spruill (D-Chesapeake) agrees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened was now you can let politics take the place of the school board,&rdquo; said Spruill. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dangerous thing to do. I&rsquo;m real surprised that they would do that. Doesn&rsquo;t matter which party. We have an elected school board. They know their region. They know their areas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Delegate Marcia &ldquo;Cia&rdquo; Price (D-Newport News) replied, &ldquo;As was mentioned, we had 45 days of early voting, and historic turnout in Virginia.

There is no such abuse,&rdquo; Delegate Marcia Price (D-Newport News) said in response to various proposals before the House. &ldquo;These efforts have been shown to impact certain groups and certain populations and that&rsquo;s just not fair. That is discrimination.&rdquo;</p></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/us/politics/black-voters-virginia.html" target="_blank">Black voters in Virginia refuse to be blamed for a major Democratic defeat.</a></h3>
<p><div>
<div>
<p>Democrats across Virginia expressed profound disappointment on Wednesday after Republicans romped to an unlikely victory in the governor&rsquo;s race, an ominous sign for the Democratic Party ahead of next year&rsquo;s midterm elections.</p>
<p>But one group refused to be blamed for the party&rsquo;s poor showing: Black voters and elected officials.</p>
<p>Fears about Black turnout and a lack of enthusiasm did not materialize in Tuesday&rsquo;s results, as former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, ran close to expected totals in the state&rsquo;s majority-Black areas. Instead, Black state leaders and voters who backed Mr. McAuliffe said the results were a sign that the party could not rely on minority voters to cover its cratering totals in more white areas of the state, particularly in rural communities that voted heavily for Glenn Youngkin, the Republican businessman who won the governor&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that Black voters are easily the first target for when things don&rsquo;t go for how they want it to go,&rdquo; said Marcia Price, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who won re-election. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trash take to look at us and not the middle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The middle said Youngkin is more palatable than Trump and they were willing to take a chance with him.&rdquo; Ms. Price&rsquo;s words reflect a sense among the state&rsquo;s Black political class that communities of color are often blamed when Democrats lose.</p>

<p><div>
<h3>Assistance for certain voters, curbside voting</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1921">HB1921</a> expands curbside voting to any voter, regardless of age or physical ability, during a declared state of emergency.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><em>Clarifies that any voter with a permanent physical disability, temporary physical disability, or injury is entitled to vote outside of the polling place.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>According to the Department of Elections, curbside voting is "generally" only available for voters 65 years and older, or with a permanent disability.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The bill requires that the area designated for voting outside of the polling place be clearly marked and instructions on how the voter is to notify an officer of election of his request to vote outside of the polling place be prominently displayed. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1890">Voting Rights Act of Virginia</a></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>In what Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called a "landmark" move, Gov. Northam this year approved the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, modeled after the Voting Rights Act of 1965.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The bill protects against voter discrimination and intimidation and requires a public comment period over any election changes made at the local level.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><em>Prohibits any voting qualification or any standard, practice, or procedure related to voting from being imposed or applied in a manner that results in the denial or abridgment of the right of any United States citizen to vote based on his race or color or membership in a language minority group.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>According to Northam's office, Virginia became the first state in the south to enact its own Voting Rights Act, and was championed by State Senator Jennifer McClellan and Newport News Delegate Marcia Price.</p>

<p><p>Marcia Price is the Democratic candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates District 95. Her name will appear on the ballot on Nov. 2.</p>

<p><strong>Race</strong>:&nbsp;Virginia House of Delegates District 95</p>

<p><strong>Biography:&nbsp;</strong>Del. Marcia &ldquo;Cia&rdquo; Price is a Democrat representing the 95th District in the Virginia House of Delegates. A 10th generation resident of Hampton Roads, Price is a lifelong advocate and public servant who is proud to represent the community who helped raise her. From passing the historic Voting Rights Act of Virginia, to protecting renters from unjust evictions and securing historic funding for education, Price has been a crucial voice for the residents of the 95th District in Richmond. She is currently running for re-election.</p>
<p><strong>Why should Virginians re-elect you to the Virginia House of Delegates?</strong></p>
<p>The people of the 95th District deserve a fighter; someone willing to stand up for them, and I&rsquo;m proud to be that person. As a delegate, I&rsquo;ve put all my effort into speaking up for those whose voices have been silenced by systemic obstacles, taking their concerns directly to Richmond, saying the things that need to be said, and doing the hard work of legislating to change lives.</p>
<p>The 757 is my home. I&rsquo;m a 10th generation resident, and the people here helped raise me. That&rsquo;s why I first ran, and why I&rsquo;m running for re-election. We have delivered results on education, healthcare, voting rights, criminal justice reform, and more. But there&rsquo;s so much left to do and I am up for the challenge to keep fighting until we build the Virginia that works for us all.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to accomplish, if elected?</strong></p>
<p>We listened to residents and did the work to deliver changes that the people of the 95th District deserve. This year alone, I led the charge to pass the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, which protects fundamental freedoms that other states are now attacking. You can&rsquo;t have a representative democracy when you&rsquo;re actively cutting out communities from the democratic process.</p>
<p>I also fought and succeeded in providing crucial funding for communities to help prevent gun violence, protected renters from eviction during the pandemic, and secured historic funding for both K-12 and higher education. These advancements took hard work, dedication, collaboration, intense research, and negotiating skills that got results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If re-elected, I will continue strengthening our democracy and voting rights protections, reforming our criminal justice system, expanding access to affordable housing, stopping unfair evictions, bringing more good-paying jobs to the district, making healthcare more affordable, protecting our environment for future generations, working with others to prevent gun violence in our communities, and helping ensure our children can thrive and follow their dreams.</p>
<p>My record is all about fighting for people who need us most, and I&rsquo;m proud of what we&rsquo;ve accomplished together. If re-elected, I will continue to do the work to represent the 95th District well.</p>
<p>What is the most important issue facing your district, and what is your position on it?</p>
<p>Gun violence and its impact on our community remains a tragic reality for far too many in the 95th District. Understanding that gun violence is preventable, we have done a lot to address firearm safety, but we have to address the health, economic, education, and justice aspects of gun violence as well.</p>
<p>We must listen to our young people and provide them with opportunities to excel and pathways forward to success. We know what works and that&rsquo;s where we are making strategic, long-term investments. This past Virginia General Assembly session, I helped secure $5.8 million for these kinds of evidence-based programs that will go directly to collaborations with community organizations in local communities like Newport News and Hampton. We must continue to work together to make sure our community is safe. Everyone can and should play a part.</p>
<p><strong>What is your position on Virginia&rsquo;s overall response to the coronavirus pandemic, and what might you have done differently?</strong></p>
<p>I know that this has been a hard road since March 2020, and we have lost so many community members to this pandemic.&nbsp;The financial impact has also hit homes across the nation, but we are doing better than most states thanks to the leadership in the Virginia General Assembly and our governor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our decisive, science-based, and collaborative decision making was key to getting the resources to those who need it, but we aren&rsquo;t out of the woods yet. We cannot allow misinformation to harm our most vulnerable communities. We can recover quicker as a Commonwealth by understanding that our individual choices impact the whole of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have already spent millions investing in free vaccinations, PPE, testing, contact tracing, rent relief, mortgage relief, utility relief, and investment in small businesses; however, more must be done at the state level to protect front-line workers and essential staff, especially those from black and brown communities, who are still disproportionately suffering due to&nbsp;lack of on-the-job support, threat of evictions, lack of access to the vaccine, and other issues that were only exacerbated by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the top three issues created by the coronavirus pandemic in your district, and how would you plan to address them?</strong></p>
<p>Amidst an ongoing global health crisis, people in the 95th District have also had to face the increased threat of evictions, lack of equitable access to healthcare, and continuing economic fallout. While these are issues that have worsened over the past two years, make no mistake: These are issues that residents of the 95th District have faced long before COVID-19.</p>
<p>The pandemic has only exacerbated existing inequities. That is why I have worked hard as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates to secure targeted investments back to the 95th District, including providing help to residents by injecting millions into the Unemployment Trust Fund, Rebuild VA (a special COVID-19 small business grant fund), and a variety of healthcare initiatives. We also took advantage of federal funding to address the eviction crisis, with more than $1 billion set aside for mortgage and rent relief. I&rsquo;m proud of what I&rsquo;ve been able to do to deliver on behalf of the people of the 95th District, but there is more to do, and if re-elected, more I will do.</p></p>

<p><p>NEWPORT NEWS, Va. - A shooting took place at<a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/students-evacuated-as-shooting-reported-at-heritage-high-school-in-newport-news">&nbsp;Heritage High School in Newport News Monday morning.</a></p>
<p>Two teens were shot: One male was shot in the side of the face, and the other was a female who was shot in the lower leg, police said, adding that neither sustained what are considered life-threatening injuries.</p>
<p>Police say a suspect is now in custody. He is a minor.</p>
<p>Local leaders are now reacting to the senseless act of violence that took place.</p>
<p><strong>Del. Cia Price</strong></p>
<div><blockquote>What happened today is a tragedy. My heart goes out to the Heritage High School and Huntington Middle School students, families, teachers, and staff impacted; and to our whole community who are confronting yet another example of gun violence. Our young people deserve a safe learning environment where they can prepare for their future and thrive; not to have to fear yet another person with a gun. This cannot become the new normal.<br />
<br />
It is so very important that we connect with these students and students all across our city and let them know that they are not alone, that we are supporting them, and that we are invested in their future. And we should encourage everyone to seek the mental health resources they need as we all process these events. Our community has proven time and time again how resilient we are, but we cannot and should not allow a community's strength to take the place of our collective responsibility to prevent gun violence.<br />
<br />
I've been in touch with local leaders here, and we are on the same page: this cannot happen again, and we are committed to wrapping our services and our arms around these students.</blockquote></div></p>

<p><p>In front of the Civil Rights Memorial on Capitol Square on a humid day, Northam addressed reporters, sometimes almost drowned out by cicadas. &ldquo;As we sit here in 2021 and think about what happened: the rapid trials, the trials by jurors that were all white men. It was wrong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We're making progress, but still have a lot of work to do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Systemic racism exists in our society. Black oppression exists. And I think a lot of people need to step back and realize that Black oppression and racism didn't stop with slavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delegate Marcia Price of Newport News said the pardons gives energy to other advocacy on racial justice. &ldquo;This was one of those opportunities to see wrongs get righted and it's really invigorating - it's powerful. But it's also inspiring for the work that is left for us to continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Virginia outlawed the death penalty this year.&nbsp;</p></p>

<p><p>Tuesday&rsquo;s announcement was welcome news to elected officials who had fought for such changes alongside Northam, including state Delegate Cia Price, D-Newport News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price entered the Virginia Legislature a term before the 2017 blue wave election which saw the young official joined by other young, Black and brown progressive lawmakers in taking control of the previously Republican-controlled body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She pointed to Tuesday&rsquo;s pardons as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/virginias-legislative-session-spotlights-shifting-political-power/">other reforms</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/virginia-set-for-legal-marijuana-possession-retail-by-2024/">marijuana legalization</a>&nbsp;and changes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/virginia-becomes-first-southern-state-to-ban-lgbt-discrimination/">civil rights laws</a>&nbsp;over the last two years, as proof of the Democratic majority's priorities and successes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Democrats have consistently been fighting for justice and I&rsquo;m proud of the work we&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; she said before stressing they are far from done. &rdquo;It&rsquo;s going to take time, but days like today show that commitment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Northam also brought family members of the Martinsville Seven to the state Capitol for a private meeting where he signed the posthumous pardon&nbsp;<a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Martinsville-Seven-Grant.pdf">document</a>.</p></p>

<p><div>
<p>The White House's latest eviction ban is over. The Supreme Court ruled evictions can resume across the nation and claimed the CDC lacks the authority to impose a ban. However, Delegate Marcia Price (D-Newport News) said there are still hundreds of millions of dollars available for tenants in Virginia. &ldquo;We do not want millions of dollars sitting in a pot just because people didn&rsquo;t know about it," said Price.&nbsp; Del. Price said it is "unfortunate" that the federal freeze ended, but Virginia has resources available for people struggling to keep a roof over their heads. As of mid-August, Price said roughly $655 million is still up for grabs through the<a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/rmrp">&nbsp;Virginia Rent Relief Program.</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;The time is now. There is no more waiting," said Price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><p>During the General Assembly&rsquo;s special session, lawmakers approved a budget to extend state-level protections for those struggling to pay rent, mortgage and utility bills due to the pandemic. &ldquo;[There's] about $655 million left in rent relief, so that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s left for landlords and tenants to apply for,&rdquo; Del. Marcia Price, who represents Virginia&rsquo;s 95<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;District, said. There&rsquo;s even funding available to help homeowners pay for their mortgage.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also an additional $258 million in mortgage relief. We&rsquo;re really trying to help people stay housed, especially during the pandemic. These funds are available for people to apply for now,&rdquo; Del. Price said.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/va-republicans-look-to-end-enhanced-unemployment-benefits-increase-funding-to-prevent-payroll-tax-hike/" target="_blank">Va. Republicans look to end enhanced unemployment benefits, increase funding to prevent payroll tax hike</a></h3>
<p><p>In a previous interview, Gov. Ralph Northam pledged that Virginians on unemployment could count on the $300 enhancement through the deadline set by Congress. &ldquo;There are individuals in Virginia that are having difficulty finding employment and, until they do that, federal help is something that will help them pay their bills. So we don&rsquo;t have any plans of eliminating that in Virginia,&rdquo; Northam told 8News in June.</p>
<p>Del. Marcia Price (D-Newport News) agrees with that approach. Asked about this on Tuesday, she said, &ldquo;The people I&rsquo;m talking to in the 95th District absolutely want to work. They just don&rsquo;t want to go back into dangerous work conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Price is among the lawmakers who backed a proposal from advocates to use ARPA funding to give bonuses to those experiencing long wait times for unemployment benefits in more complex cases. That does not appear to be included in the current spending plan that advanced out of committee on Monday, based on a budget briefing given to legislators.</p>

<p><p>Right now, it&rsquo;s optional for landlords to apply on behalf of tenants. Democratic lawmakers like Cia Price want to make it mandatory, as it was from late November through June. That setup won praise from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/opinion/eviction-moratorium-covid-philadelphia.html" target="_blank">New York Times&rsquo; editorial board</a>&nbsp;as a model for other states where the funds have languished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unconscionable that there would be evictions when the money is there,&rdquo; Price said.</p>
<p>So far, the fund has helped over 48,000 households with over $300 million in rent money; nearly $700 million remains left to disperse. The budget proposed by Gov. Ralph Northam that is currently under consideration by the General Assembly would allow the program to be extended through June 2022 or until the funds are exhausted.</p></p>

<p>Bucking the trend of other states passing restrictive and repressive voter suppression laws in response to Trump's Big Lie, the commonwealth of Virginia is bucking this trend by passing its Voting Rights Act, with the novel idea that all citizens have the right to vote. What led to the first Southern state--and the first state previously covered by "preclearance" in the 1965 Voting Rights Act--to pass a bill expanding voting rights? Virginia State Sen.

The program has been cited as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/opinion/eviction-moratorium-covid-philadelphia.html">a national model</a>, but corresponding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/with-northams-signature-new-eviction-and-utility-cut-off-protections-take-effect/">eviction protections</a>&nbsp;that required landlords to notify tenants financial help was available and apply on their behalf&nbsp;<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/24/virginia-has-more-than-a-billion-dollars-in-aid-for-people-behind-on-rent-heres-how-to-get-it/">ended in June</a>, when Gov. Ralph Northam allowed the pandemic state of emergency to expire.</p>
<p>At the time, Northam&rsquo;s administration stressed that the rent relief program still had millions of dollars available, money they believed landlords would tap into even in the absence of a mandate.</p>
<p>But as they gaveled into a special legislative session Monday, Virginia lawmakers said they believe a mandate is still necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I think we are finding is that there are still quite a few landlords and tenants that do not know that the money is available,&rdquo; said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News. &ldquo;So what we&rsquo;re trying to do is make sure that if it&rsquo;s mandated as part of the process, they&rsquo;ll have to find out about it.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p><p dir="ltr">Delegate Cia Price is a Democrat from Newport News who says this is not the time to evict people who are having a hard time making ends meet.&nbsp; "This should not be used as an opportunity to get rid of anyone," explains Price. "Get your money, and then let's move forward."&nbsp; Both the House and the Senate would need to agree on an exemption for small-scale landlords, so the fate of this proposal will play out as the special session progresses this week.</p></p>

<h3><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/eviction-moratorium-to-expire-heres-how-you-can-get-rent-relief-money" target="_blank">With the eviction moratorium set to expire, here's how you can get rent relief money</a></h3>
<p><p>"It&rsquo;s really important for people to know this is not a loan. This is free money to pay your rent if you have had a negative impact because of COVID," Del. Marcia Price said.&nbsp; To apply, there must be a loss of income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. People interested in applying for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wtkr.com/rebound/coronavirus-money-help/virginia-rent-relief-program-can-help-tenants-after-eviction-moratorium-ends">Rent Relief Program</a>&nbsp;can call 703-962-1884 to do so. "The program is set up where either the landlord or tenant can apply. You do not have to be going through an eviction at the moment to apply for it. Once it&rsquo;s found that you&rsquo;re eligible, the funds go to the landlord for the rent that&rsquo;s due," Del. Price said.</p>

<p><p>Within the last two years, the state&rsquo;s Democrat-controlled General Assembly and Governor Ralph Northam have secured no-excuse mail-in ballots, repealed a restrictive voter ID law, enacted automatic voter registration and made Election Day a state holiday &ndash; marking a radical expansion of voting rights that advocates now are fighting to protect, or risk undermining generational progress against a tide of suppressive voting laws across the US. &ldquo;It can go away,&rdquo; said the bill&rsquo;s author, Virginia Representative Marcia Price. &ldquo;I think people sometimes don&rsquo;t really understand how fragile this process really is,&rdquo; she told&nbsp;<em>The Independent.&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;In my eyes, America&rsquo;s democracy started in 1965 and not a day before that. What are we doing to protect it, feed it and nurture it? I think the next step is continuing to protect the progress that we&rsquo;ve made and fighting back against the big lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not blind faith or trust in humanity that got us the Voting Rights Act [of 1965],&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was literal blood, sweat and tears. &hellip; I don&rsquo;t have the luxury to believe in the best in humanity. I need the laws to protect my rights, my community&rsquo;s rights and everybody&rsquo;s rights. I have hope in the people who have put their lives on the line because we&rsquo;ve had to do that for generations to get the changes that we needed. That is what keeps us going.&rdquo;</p>

<p><div>
<p>The nationwide eviction moratorium ends on July 31, and Del.

<p>Price says people should know there are options.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a 14-day notice to pay or quit. There are payment plans. There's a 60-day stay for an eviction for a tenant and a 30-day stay for foreclosure for a homeowner,&rdquo; she mentioned.&nbsp; The "Know Your Rights: Housing Edition" event will take place Saturday, July 24, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Downing-Gross Cultural Arts Center at 2410 Wickham Avenue. It will also feature the City of Newport News, the Legal Aid Society of Eastern Virginia, Tidewater Tenants Rights, Consumer Litigation Associates, and the Virginia Poverty Law Center.&nbsp; It will be live-streamed on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/PriceForDel95" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Del.

<p><p>Earlier this year, the Virginia Voting Rights Act was championed in the Virginia General Assembly by state Sen. Jennifer McClellan of Richmond and Delegate Marcia Price of Newport News and signed into law by Gov. Ralph S. Northam. Passage of the Virginia Voting Rights Act initially was hailed as a secondary safeguard against new voter restrictions. But last week, this new legislation instantly became our life raft of last resort to protect our right to vote. As the national NAACP put in a statement, &ldquo;The 6-3 ruling in Brnovich v. Democratic National Convention places new restrictions on Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which was signed into law almost 40 years ago by Ronald Reagan. The Court sent the clear message that vote suppressors around the country will go unchecked as they enact voting restrictions that disproportionately impact voters of color.&rdquo; Since the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling, I have been asked repeatedly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo; The easy answer would be that we need to pressure Congress to pass legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act or similar reforms. However, here at the Virginia NAACP, we believe that now more than ever we must enshrine the right to vote in our state Constitution. We must work tirelessly to pass SJ272, championed by state Sen. Mamie Locke of Hampton.</p></p>

<p>RICHMOND, Va.&mdash;On July 1, Virginia will implement eight more voting rights expansion measures backed by the House Democrats, making voting more accessible for all eligible voters to cast their ballots, which contrasts how Republicans nation-wide have advocated for voting restrictions.&nbsp;
<p>&ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve seen across the nation, in Republican-led state legislatures, they are repeating history and punishing Black and Brown voters for exercising their power. In Virginia, under our leadership, we know that our democracy is strongest when everyone can participate,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Delegate Cia Price,&nbsp;the patron of&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1890">HB 1980</a>.&nbsp;&ldquo;The Voting Rights Act of Virginia protects the rights of historically suppressed communities instead of attacking them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, when Virginia House of Delegates experienced its first Democratic majority in more than 20 years,&nbsp;<a href="https://vahousedems.org/2020/06/10/virginia-house-democrats-usher-in-sweeping-expansions-to-voting-rights/">House Democrats passed sweeping voting rights legislation</a>&nbsp;including creating a permanent absentee vote-by-mail option, removing the excuse requirement for absentee voting, enacting same-day voter registration, establishing Election Day as a state holiday, expanding the voter identification law to include certain non-photo IDs, making voter registration applications available at high schools and colleges, authorizing automatic voter registration, and providing voting materials for non-English-speaking citizens in localities where a language minority group includes at least 10,000 voters or five percent of the voting population.&nbsp;</p>

<p><div data-type="text">
<div>
<p data-page="1" data-item-type="depthscroll" data-item-id="depth_scroll_top" data-item-number="top">A Newport News state delegate and a prominent local criminal defense lawyer will talk about Virginia&rsquo;s marijuana legalization on Wednesday evening in a Zoom call. The discussion &mdash; open to the public &mdash; is part of a new &ldquo;Conversations with the Clerk&rdquo; series sponsored by Newport News Clerk of Circuit Court Angela Reason. The online discussion between Reason, Del. Marcia &ldquo;Cia&rdquo; Price, D-Newport News, and attorney Timothy Clancy will begin at 6 p.m. Price was heavily involved in the recent effort to legalize marijuana, while Clancy is an expert on the current state laws on the issue.</p>
<p>The Zoom ID to get access to the discussion is 844-4057-6466. The Virginia General Assembly voted earlier this year to legalize the simple possession of marijuana for adults ages 21 and older. That&rsquo;s up to an ounce, with no intent to distribute, and adults can grow up to four plants per household. But the law, which goes into effect July 1, is still considered confusing and a work in progress because it&rsquo;s still against the law to both buy and sell pot. It&rsquo;s also still illegal to use it in public or while driving. Lawmakers are still hashing out the details of how the marijuana marketplace will be formed and regulated.</p>
