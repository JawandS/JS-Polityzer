<strong>Termination of Services<br></strong><br>
<ol type="A">
<li>You’re free to terminate your Account at any time by shutting down your Account yourself or contacting us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#533b363f23133d32273a3c3d31263a3f3736217d303c3e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="dfb7bab3af9fb1beabb6b0b1bdaab6b3bbbaadf1bcb0b2">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Terminating your Account does not end your payment obligations. Your payment obligations are governed by the terms of your plan. If you are a standard customer on a month-to-month contract, your payment obligations end at the end of your payment cycle for the month in which you canceled. If you are on a separate plan (i.e,. an Enterprise plan), your payment obligations are as set forth in your contract, according to your contract term length. Please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as any applicable Additional Terms, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. You must download all of your Data (but not any Third-Party Appended Data (if you have signed up for this Service)) prior to the date upon which your termination is effective. Once your Account is terminated, for security reasons, your Account access will be terminated and you will not have access to download your data.</li>
<li>Unless you have a separate agreement with us specifying otherwise, we are also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your Account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Master Terms. We have the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Master Terms.</li>
<li>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Master Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any warranty disclaimers, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</li>
<li>We may modify or terminate the Service or any part thereof in any country or jurisdiction where there is any current or future government requirement or obligation that (1) subjects us to a regulation or requirement not generally applicable to our operations there or to a business based in that country, (2) presents a hardship for us to continue operating the Service or any part thereof in that country or jurisdiction without modification, and/or (3) causes us to believe that these terms or the Service or any part thereof may conflict with any such requirement or obligation. If we terminate the service for regulatory reasons, we will provide you with a credit for any amount paid in advance for the period after the termination.<br><br>

In the event of any such closure of your Account, you will not be eligible for a refund of any fees and you may be prohibited from reopening your Account, opening a new Account or accessing any existing Account.

You agree to hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, losses or damages arising from any suspension of your Account or the individual Service. Removing an Account from suspension is in our sole discretion.

<p><strong>Account Owner/Admin/Ownership Transfers</strong></p>
<p>Requests to transfer ownership of a Nation fall under three classes: (i) Type A transfers, which are those Account Owner/Admin/Ownership transfers initiated by the Account Owner/Admin via the Control Panel; (ii) Type B transfers, which are those Account Owner/Admin/Ownership transfer requests initiated by someone other than the Account Owner/Admin; or (iii) Type C transfers, which are those Account Owner/Admin/Ownership transfer requests initiated by the beneficiary, lawful heir, Power of Attorney, or Executor of a deceased Account Owner/Admin's estate. NationBuilder may, in its sole discretion, deny any request to transfer ownership of a Nation.</p>
<p>(i) Type A Transfers:</p>
<p>In the case of Type A Account Owner/Admin/Ownership transfer requests, the owner name fields are changed by the Account Owner/Admin via the Control Panel. Once changed, all rights and obligations granted to the former Account Owner/Admin under this Agreement will immediately transfer to the new Account Owner/Admin. Transfer of ownership only affects ownership of the Nation.</p>
<p>(ii) Type B Transfers:</p>
<p>In the case of Type B Account Owner/Admin/Ownership transfer requests, the person who is not the listed Account Owner/Admin in our records, but believes he/she/it should be sends us a request (1) identifying the Account Owner/Admin in our records, (2) setting forth why the Account Owner/Admin/Ownership should be transferred and (3) any evidence supporting the transfer. We may make a good-faith attempt to reach the current Account Owner/Admin via telephone, or email to allow him/her the opportunity to approve or deny the request. If the Account Owner/Admin expressly objects to the transfer request, we will be unable to assist the other party with accessing the Nation without a valid, applicable court order. On the other hand, if we are unable to reach the current Account Owner/Admin, for whatever reason, or if we do not receive a timely response to any of our communications, we may proceed with the transfer of ownership as requested without further notice.</p>
<p>(iii) Type C Transfers:</p>
<p>In the case of Type C Account Owner/Adminship transfer requests, the person who is not the listed Account Owner/Admin in our records, but believes he/she/it should be sends us a request (1) identifying the Account Owner/Admin in our records, (2) setting forth why the Account Owner/Admin/Ownership should be transferred, including proof of the Account Owner/Admin’s death, and (3) any evidence supporting the transfer, including documentation that the requestor is beneficiary, lawful heir, Power of Attorney, or Executor. We may, in our sole discretion, proceed with the transfer of ownership as requested.</p>
<p>(iv) Effects of Type B and C Transfers:</p>
<p>Once ownership of an account has been processed: (i) All rights and obligations granted to the former Account Owner/Admin under this Agreement will immediately cease and be transferred to the new Account Owner/Admin; (ii) NationBuilder will remove the former Account Owner/Admin's registration data and replace it with the registration data provided by the new Account Owner/Admin; and (iii) NationBuilder may also remove the former Account Owner/Admin's Payment Method. NationBuilder will not modify any other facet of the Nation or the Service; the new Account Owner/Admin is solely responsible for doing so. Before any approved transfer of ownership can be completed, NationBuilder must receive full payment of any balance owing on the Nation as of the approval date. An approved transfer of ownership only affects ownership and control of the Nation.</p>

The Master Terms and this Amendment shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the United States of America without reference to conflict of laws. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of the State of California will apply in the absence of federal law, excluding California’s choice of law rules.</li>
<li>
<strong>Changes to Master Terms.</strong> If Company exercises its right to change the Master Terms, Company shall, whenever practicable, provide notice to subscribers with .gov email addresses alerting them to the change. Company acknowledges that changes to the Master Terms may be the basis for Agency’s termination of this agreement and its use of the Services.</li>
<li>
<strong>Access and Use.</strong> Company acknowledges that the Agency’s use of the Services may energize significant citizen engagement and otherwise become important to the Agency’s mission. Language in the Master Terms allowing Company to terminate service or close the Agency’s Account at any time, for any reason, is modified to reflect the Parties’ agreement that Company may unilaterally terminate service and/or terminate Agency’s Account only for breach of Agency’s obligations under the Master Terms or Agency’s material failure to comply with the instructions and guidelines posted on the Company’s website or as part of the Services, or if Company ceases to operate its website or Services generally. Company will provide Agency with a reasonable opportunity to cure any breach or failure on Agency’s part.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ownership of Names.</strong> Any provision in the Master Terms related to Company’s ownership of and right to change your selected user name(s), user ID(s), domain name(s), nation name(s), and group name(s), are modified to reasonably accommodate Agency’s proprietary, practical, and/or operational interest in its own publicly-recognized name and the names of Agency programs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Modifications of Agency Content.</strong> Any right Company reserves in the Master Terms to modify or adapt Agency content is limited to technical actions necessary to index, format and display that content. The right to modify or adapt does not include the right to substantively edit or otherwise alter the meaning of the content. In the event Agency discovers that Agency content has been modified in a manner that alters the meaning of such content, Agency may contact Company and the Parties shall work together in good faith to resolve the matter. In addition, the provision in the Master Terms allowing the company to remove any comment at any time in its sole discretion shall not be applied to Agency Accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Amendment shall result in an expansion of Agency’s rights as a United States Government entity under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. §101 et seq.), specifically including Section 105 of such Act.</li>
<li>
<strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> The Parties agree that nothing in the limitation of liability provisions in the Master Terms in any way grants Company a waiver from, release of, or limitation of liability pertaining to, any past, current or future violation of federal law.</li>
<li>
<strong>Uploading; Deleting.</strong> The Parties understand and agree that You are not obligated to place any user content on any website to which You are provided access as part of the Services, and You reserve the right to remove any and all of Your Content at Your sole discretion.</li>
<li>
<strong>No Endorsement.</strong> Company agrees that Your seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, and the fact that You have a presence on the Company’s website and use its Services, shall not be used by Company in such a manner as to state or imply that Company’s products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by You or by any other element of the Federal Government, or are considered by You or the Federal Government to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages whose design and content is under the control of the Agency, or for links to or promotion of such pages, Company agrees not to display any Agency or government seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names on the Company’s homepage or elsewhere on the Company’s website unless permission to do has been granted by the Agency or by other relevant federal government authority. Company may list the Agency’s name in a publicly available customer list on its homepage or elsewhere so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other third-party name.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paid Services and Agency Obligation.</strong> The Parties agree this Amendment applies to Agency’s usage of both free and paid Services that Company may provide. The Parties understand that fee-based products and services are categorically different than free products and services, and are subject to federal procurement rules and processes. Before an Agency decides to enter into a premium or enterprise subscription, or any other fee-based service that this Company or alternative providers may offer now or in the future, Agency agrees to determine if it has a need for those additional services for a fee, to consider the subscription’s value in comparison with comparable services available elsewhere, to determine that Agency funds are available for payment, to properly use the Government Purchase Card if that Card is used as the payment method, to review any then-applicable Master Terms for conformance to federal procurement law, and in all other respects to follow applicable federal acquisition laws, regulations, and agency guidelines when initiating that separate action.</li>
<li>
<strong>Assignment.</strong> Neither Party may assign its obligations under the Master Terms as modified by this Amendment to any third party without prior written consent of the other; provided however, Company or its subsidiaries may assign the Master Terms as modified by this Amendment to a subsidiary or parent without written consent from the Agency provided that the successor assumes Company’s obligations under the Master Terms as modified by this Amendment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Termination rights.</strong> If the law requires for the particular U.S. Government entity customer, the Agency may close Agency’s Account and terminate this Amendment at any time. Company may close Agency’s Account and terminate this Amendment on 30 days written notice.</li>
<li>
<strong>Security.</strong> Company will, in good faith, exercise due diligence using generally accepted commercial business practices for IT security, to ensure that systems are operated and maintained in a secure manner, and that management, operational and technical controls are employed to ensure security of systems and data.</li>
<li>
<strong>Intellectual property ownership.</strong> Except as expressly allowed in the Master Terms, no rights to any derivative works, inventions, or Company product modifications are conferred on Agency or any other party. All such rights belong solely to Company.</li>
<li>
<strong>Additional Items for Discussion and Possible Inclusion in this Amendment.</strong> Company understands current federal law, regulation and policy may affect Agency’s use of the Company’s products and Services in ways not addressed in the list of clauses above. Among the topics Agency may need to discuss with Company, and which may lead to a mutual agreement to insert additional clauses in this Amendment, are Privacy and Accessibility.<br><br>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Other Terms<br></strong><br>
<ol type="A">
<li>
<strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Master Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto. You may be subject to additional third-party terms and policies based on your use of the Services. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder. In the event of a conflict between these Master Terms and any applicable purchase or other terms, these Master Terms shall govern. If any provision of these Master Terms is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision will be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of these Master Terms will continue in full force and effect. The headings of sections and paragraphs in these Master Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect its interpretation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Choice of Laws.</strong> The Master Terms are governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</li>
<li>
<strong>Notices.</strong> We may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on the Services, as determined by us. We are not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. We recommend that you add <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="deb7b0b8b19eb0bfaab7b1b0bcabb7b2babbacf0bdb1b3">[email&#160;protected]</a> to your email address book to help ensure you receive email notifications from us.</li>
<li>No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Master Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind us in any respect whatsoever. You and we agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Master Terms.</li>
<li>
<strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor we will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity, and each party hereby waives any right to assert consolidated claims with respect to any disputes subject to arbitration under these Master Terms or any disputes between the parties. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Limitation of Time to File Claims.</strong> Any action, claim or dispute you have against us must be filed within one year from the date the action, claim or dispute could first be filed. To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under these Master Terms must be filed within one year in an arbitration proceeding. If a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.</li>
<li>
<strong>Changes to the Master Terms.</strong> We may revise and update these Master Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Assignment and Transfer.</strong> You may not assign, transfer or convey these Master Terms or any obligations thereunder without our prior written consent. Any assignment, transfer or conveyance by you in violation of these Master Terms shall be of no power or effect. By agreeing to these Master Terms, you consent to the storing and processing of your personal information, including sensitive information, in the United States or in other countries. We use a range of measures to safeguard information, but these countries may have laws that are different from those of your country of residence. You also consent to the personal information, including sensitive information, of you and that of the individuals in your nations and networked nations, being assigned, transferred or conveyed in the event of a business transition such as, but not limited to, a merger, sale, asset or stock acquisition of us by another company, or other transaction or proceeding. In such a case, your information would be used as set out in our Privacy Policy. We may assign, transfer, or convey (whether by contract, merger, or operation of law) these Master Terms, or any portion thereof, in our sole discretion.</li>
