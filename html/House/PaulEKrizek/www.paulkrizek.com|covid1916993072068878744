All public and private in-person gatherings of more than 25 individuals are prohibited.

Some businesses (ie, restaurants) are prohibited from hosting over 25 people in a party, however, they may still have more than 25 people on their premises if six feet of physical distance allows. The 25 person gathering ban DOES apply to private parties and social events that may be hosted at restaurants, breweries, wineries, or entertainment and public amusement venues -- for example, wedding receptions.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>What changed in the mask order?</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All individuals aged 5 and older must wear face coverings in indoor public settings, including schools and childcare.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;<strong>Has enforcement of the mask order change?</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>What is the deal with essential retail businesses?</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Commonwealth’s public health experts have been recommending that essential retail businesses use the best&nbsp;practices&nbsp;on physical distancing, disinfection, and workplace safety in Guidelines for All Business Sectors.

The relief will allow these customers to renew their driver’s licenses or identification cards for a two-year period online or through the mail, rather than by the statutorily required in-person visit to a DMV customer service center (CSC). When the two-year credential expires (hopefully once the pandemic has ended), customers will then visit a DMV in person to renew and obtain a five-year or eight-year credential and have a new photograph taken. We have heard from seniors fearful of venturing out during the pandemic that this option was in high demand. The online service for seniors went live this morning and customers are being notified of the new&nbsp;option via their preferred method of contact, either email or regular mail. DMV issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/general/news/pressReleases/#/News_Article:14520" target="_blank">news release</a>&nbsp;today on the topic. DMV estimates approximately 20,000 customers will benefit immediately from this service and approximately 7,500 customers per month in subsequent months. Customers can learn more by visiting&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dmvnow.com/2yrdl" target="_blank">www.dmvNOW.com/2yrdl</a>. Over 50,000 Virginians under 75 years of age have already taken advantage&nbsp;of this new service option since the September&nbsp;15th rollout.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition, DMV is working with the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts statewide to help juveniles obtain their first-time driver’s licenses in a timely manner during the pandemic. Under normal circumstances, driver’s licenses for customers under age 18 are sent to the judge of the customer’s local Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. The Court then notifies customers by mail and minors appear in court with their parents, custodial parents, or legal guardians to participate in a licensing ceremony and receive their license. Due to the pandemic, some Courts are no longer holding licensing ceremonies. DMV is working with Courts to determine which localities are not holding licensing ceremonies so those driver’s licenses can be sent directly to the minor, rather than to the Court. This fix was in the&nbsp;Governor's Budget as introduced. As a result&nbsp;of a budget amendment proposed by Delegate Krizek and Senator Marsden, during a declared state of emergency DMV may now permit Class B driver training schools and computer-based driver education providers to administer the end-of-course driver's education test online; Class B driver training schools to administer their in-class curriculum on an online platform; and the parent/student driver education component of the driver's education course to be administered online. DMV will work directly with interested schools.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Also beginning today, DMV is offering commercial driver’s license (CDL) holders the ability to renew online. Previously, CDL holders were required to visit the DMV in person each time to renew the credential. Detailed information on CDL online renewal eligibility can be found at: <a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#renewcdl.asp" target="_blank">https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#renewcdl.asp</a>. The service should benefit 2,300 Virginians per month. DMV will issue a news release announcing the change on Monday.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">September 1: Governor Northam announced this afternoon an amendment to Executive Directive Seven (ED 7) to further extend the validity of credentials issued by DMV. The Fifth Amended ED 7, effective August 28, extends the validity of driver’s licenses, learner’s permits, and identification cards originally expiring in August, September, and October 2020 for 60 days beyond the expiration date displayed on the credential. Customers who have not yet renewed a driver’s license, learner’s permit, or ID card already expired in August are eligible for this extension at no penalty. In addition, the validity of driver’s licenses, learner’s permits, and ID cards that expire in November has been extended through November 30, 2020. It is important to note that vehicle registrations have not been further extended. DMV is also preparing to implement a new option for driver’s license and ID renewals. Beginning in mid-September, most customers who are due to renew their eight-year credential in person (because they renewed online or by mail last time) will be offered two options for renewing:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight-year/renew by appointment – schedule an appointment to renew the driver’s license or ID card for the full eight years.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two-year/renew remotely (new) – renew online or by mail for a driver’s license or ID card that will be valid for two years. DMV will mail the credential to the customer’s address on file. In two years, these customers will need to visit a DMV in person for their next renewal, vision screening, and new photo for an eight-year credential. This option is currently not available for customers age 75 or older as Virginia law requires an in-person renewal every five years. However, we understand that there is budget language under consideration that would ease the in-person requirement as a result of the pandemic.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">August 5: <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>COVIDWISE Mobile Alert App</strong></span></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today, Governor Northam and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) announced that the Commonwealth is launching a free app that will notify the user if they may have come into contact with another app user who has tested positive for COVID-19.

The payment relief is the result of a new initiative by Virginia and several other states to work with the major private student loan servicers to expand on protections for federal student loan borrowers through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Under this initiative, Virginians with commercially-owned Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) loans, Perkins loans, or privately held student loans who are struggling to make their payments due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will be eligible for expanded relief. Borrowers in need of assistance must immediately contact their student loan servicer to identify the options that are appropriate to their circumstances. Relief options include:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Providing a minimum of 90 days of forbearance</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Waiving late payment fees</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ensuring that no borrower is subject to negative credit reporting</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ceasing debt collection lawsuits for 90 days</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Working with borrower to enroll them in other borrower assistance programs, such as income-based repayment</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These options will provide short-term relief for borrowers with significant changes in their income, which is advisable over the option of non-payment which can lead to default. Borrowers should note that these solutions will impact the terms and conditions of the loans. Before exercising these options, carefully consider the impact of the interest that accrues during the 90-day forbearance and how it will extend the repayment schedule for the loans.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">April 28: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2020/april/headline-856370-en.html" target="_blank">Governor Northam signed Executive Order 60</a>&nbsp;which clarifies certain immunity from liability for healthcare providers.&nbsp;Virginia’s code offers protections for healthcare workers and first responders in cases of emergency and this order clarifies that this includes the COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">April 28: Attorney General Mark Herring announced that the Commonwealth has&nbsp;<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001sopNi1MUJcmC_rQhVPHwczFyc7KnzZ6K-WE7A6HHhajYrQDLYOxjjjvPPGq9sXBMH1zMINsYU9hDKfmLBxcpQF1NFpyRB3cGZgoXMW4MW9TjINpxBgpnAVbOVaomZ9qDEn8mvyPOBOPDQi5O7TDSDyxAWUhCDvgeYG2mIPyU_TlOmc7Nw7ueX2lC3ZFn5bjxKZ9_tQGmhsQYQ3n_2WJNQ_d0Ya1n9y8zrz7WYr5NxAQ=&amp;c=3ZQMUqf6LqFmxwmo4DMuPgU_kwEpFb5G25cLqpX4a9Gqw41NCAVYzg==&amp;ch=S05OtSzKrPl1BaO35ldys2Hsk3lOPOah3pQRfNlqhTEK-nzwwxySwQ==" target="_blank">reached an agreement</a>&nbsp;that will help ensure safe absentee voting for the upcoming June 23 primaries.&nbsp;Under the terms of a proposed consent decree,&nbsp;the Commonwealth will accept absentee ballots without the signature of a witness “for voters who believe they may not safely have a witness present while completing their ballot.”&nbsp;The order is proposed to the court and will not be final and effective until entered by the court.&nbsp;A copy of the brief in support of the agreement is available&nbsp;<a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001sopNi1MUJcmC_rQhVPHwczFyc7KnzZ6K-WE7A6HHhajYrQDLYOxjjjvPPGq9sXBM26fPSeVk5V3Jywp-TTxg9zi_ou7kYEPzjLq1-TMSphsEeBfM4Q-eIoNGNOXkdGAsGvPcJJ5CeImhPCj1EXiBTQ-Hx6RbnlDYyj5Yx6Yvn2BbyKSVRlXjE0vEvnsQKn-Cv31vsoZUqWusxA6x70mxS0eIUzokEWqYqcL17KcLEeU=&amp;c=3ZQMUqf6LqFmxwmo4DMuPgU_kwEpFb5G25cLqpX4a9Gqw41NCAVYzg==&amp;ch=S05OtSzKrPl1BaO35ldys2Hsk3lOPOah3pQRfNlqhTEK-nzwwxySwQ==" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a reminder, the Governor postponed the local general and special elections from May 5th to May 19th.
