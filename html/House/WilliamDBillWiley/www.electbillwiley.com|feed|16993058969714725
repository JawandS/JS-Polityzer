<h4>Councilman Bill Wiley Announces for Vacant House of Delegates Seat</h4>
<p>Winchester, VA – Winchester City Councilman Bill Wiley (R) announced his candidacy for the 29th House of Delegates District vacated by Chris Collins.</p>
<p>“I want to thank Chris Collins for his service in the House of Delegates, he put in years of hard work for the Northern Shenandoah Valley, and has helped us make progress on important initiatives to bring more jobs and represented us well,” said Wiley. “As your Delegate, I will continue to fight for our fair share of tax dollars from Richmond, work to repeal unfunded mandates on our localities, create a better job climate, and push for common sense policies that will make the Commonwealth a better place to live, work and raise a family.”</p>
<p>“It would be my honor to serve in the House of Delegates. I have never been afraid to stand up for what’s right, and I won’t back down in Richmond. You can count on me to stand up for our values. I proudly support our Second Amendment, the Right to Life, will reject costly tax hikes, and will oppose radical initiatives to defund the police that will make us less safe,” said Wiley.</p>
<p>“As your Delegate I will work tirelessly every day to stand up for our region and our values in Richmond and am eager to meet the voters of the 29th District and earn their support,” concluded Wiley.<br /> William Wiley has been a member of City council since 2014 voted Vice-President in 2015 and President in 2018. Prior to being elected to City Council, Wiley served for five years on the Winchester Planning Commission and was Chairman for three of those years. Professionally, he serves as the business development manager for Howard Shockey and Sons, Inc. and is an associate real estate broker at Oakcrest Commercial Real Estate. He resides in Ward 1 of Winchester with his Wife, Katy and three boys, Clarke, Stewart, &amp; Dawson. He is a graduate of George Mason University with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and a Master’s in Education.</p></div>
