				<div class="paragraph"><span><font size="4">The General Assembly adjourned Sine Die on Saturday, marking the official close of the 2023 legislative session. Though we have completed work on the nearly 2000 pieces of legislation filed during our short, 46-day session, our budget conferees still need to iron out the differences between the proposed Senate and House budgets. Though we complete the budgeting process by the close of most legislative sessions, it is not unheard of for budget negotiations to continue into a special session.

Similarly, our narrow, two seat majority in the State Senate was able to defeat the most extreme far-right proposals of the Youngkin agenda - legislation to restrict reproductive care, move backward on combating climate change, and discriminate and harass transgender youth were all defeated by the tightest of margins in the Senate.&nbsp;</font></span></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><font size="4">The clock is ticking as the General Assembly moves rapidly towards adjournment. Legislators and staff are putting in long hours in committee and on the floor to complete business by &ldquo;Sine Die,&rdquo; the final adjournment of the 2023 legislative session. &nbsp;With only 46 days scheduled to complete our business, there is little time remaining to find agreement on a budget, nominate and approve judges, and review the remainder of the over 1,800 pieces of legislation introduced this year. &nbsp;With both bodies having reported an amended budget, a small group of senior legislators, known as budget conferees, from the Senate and House money committees are hard at work on producing a compromise budget that both bodies are comfortable signing off on and sending to the Governor. It may seem improbable to produce such a document when the two proposals have a $1 billion gap in proposed spending. At a micro level, the budgets are also in disagreement on close to 100 substantive policy decisions and smaller alterations to state agency and program funding. Despite these wide differences, compromise, like the late-night coffee the conferees are consuming, is already brewing.&nbsp;</font><br /><span></span><font size="4"><br />Before our scheduled adjournment on Saturday February 25th, the General Assembly must also take up the nomination and appointment of a number of judges from across the Commonwealth. The process by which Virginia selects its judges &ndash; from general district to the Supreme Court is fairly unique. Virginia is one of only two states where the legislature elects judges. The Governor can only weigh in on the process during the interim between sessions, when he can make short term appointments to unfilled seats, pending the approval of the legislature. This year we are tasked to fill seats in all five levels of Virginia&rsquo;s courts, and, fairly unusually, to appoint two judges to the State Corporation Commission (SCC). The SCC is the independent regulatory authority that oversees utilities, insurance, and businesses in Virginia. There are currently two vacancies on the three member panel, one of which has been empty for a full year after House Republicans removed an exceptionally qualified judge from the commission for purely partisan reasons. Leaving the Commission shorthanded for this long reduces consumers' safeguards against unfair business practices. To help alleviate these concerns, Delegate Kathy Byron (R-Bedford) and Senator Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) have introduced legislation to streamline the process of appointing these important judges. The extended debate this session about the role of the SCC in reviewing energy rates and the enactment of clean energy underscores how necessary it is that we take action and fill these positions as soon as possible.&nbsp;</font><br /><span></span><font size="4"><br />The last major agenda item is to finish business on all remaining bills. A portion of the still outstanding legislation must have passed both chambers, but with different amendments offered by each body which can sometimes substantially change the underlying policy. &nbsp;To rectify these differences, these bills will be placed in committees of conference &ndash; small groups of legislators who are tasked with ironing out the differences outside of the normal chamber and committee process.</font><br /><span></span><font size="4"><br />So far, nine of my bills have passed the House. My SB 1091, which would allow condominium owners to apply for joint grants to complete flood mitigation projects, has now passed both chambers and is heading to the Governor&rsquo;s desk for his signature. SB1087 which establishes the nation&rsquo;s strongest privacy protections for your genetic data collected by ancestry.com and 23andme passed out unanimously. I was also glad to pass legislation providing living organ donors 60 days of unpaid leave to recover from this life saving procedure, and institute studies to address the rampant and frustrating vehicle noise we have seen across our region, as well as review how to license and regulate vaporized nicotine stores.&nbsp;</font><br /><span></span><font size="4"><br />However, I was disappointed that my two bills designed to help promote safety and reduce gun violence, were defeated in the House of Delegates and that my SJ 242, which would have provided voters with an opportunity to vote to repeal Virginia&rsquo;s constitutional prohibition on same-sex marriage, was defeated in subcommittee in the House of Delegates.&nbsp;While I am disheartened that those important pieces of legislation did not pass, I will continue to fight in the future to ensure Virginia has a constitution that reflects its values.&nbsp;</font><br /><span></span><font size="4"><br /><span>I look forward to the challenge, and it is my continued honor to serve the 30th District.&nbsp;</span></font><br /><span></span></div>

				<div class="paragraph">Both houses of the General Assembly reported a proposed budget a few days after the halfway point of our 46-day legislative session. While both budgets use the Governor&rsquo;s proposal as a jumping off point, often the outcomes are drastically different &ndash; especially in years of split government. A budget is a list of priorities, and it can tell a great deal about the values and priorities of its authors. Reviewing the proposed budgets from the House of Delegates, and State Senate, it is evident that these bodies have differing sets of priorities based around a central fundamental of governing: should we invest in core public services or cut revenues?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />From a 10,000-foot view, the difference between our two proposed budgets comes down to that &ndash; the House has chosen to align with the Governor&rsquo;s proposal of cutting more than $1 billion in taxes, mainly for large corporations and Virginia&rsquo;s highest earners. The Senate proposal retains existing, already comparatively low, tax rates on those individuals and entities, and chooses instead to inject most of that $1 billion into public education.&nbsp;<br /><br />Still, there are some areas of agreement.&nbsp;<br /><br />The two bodies are mostly in accord on pay for state employees. Both amended budgets include an additional two percent raise for state employees. This raise will be on top of a five percent raise that was approved last year, in an attempt to better keep up with inflation. However, there is disagreement on how to allocate bonuses to qualified public servants. The Senate&rsquo;s proposal is to send a $1,000 dollar bonus to all state employees on December 1st 2023, while the House&rsquo;s proposal is to give targeted bonuses to the state employees who work in departments and agencies with the highest employment vacancies. I believe it is important to give these bonuses to the broadest possible swath of public servants, and I will be advocating for this measure in the final budget.<br /><br />The largest difference between the two proposed budgets is the total allocation for public education. In recent weeks it was uncovered that the Youngkin administration had miscalculated the amount of funds that it would be able to allocate to local school divisions because their calculations did not take into account the elimination of the state portion of the grocery tax, an action we took last year.<br /><br />The miscalculations shorted Virginia school districts approximately 220 million dollars. Both houses of the General Assembly sought to replace these finds. The House of Delegates has set aside just 4.9 million dollars to make up this funding. The Senate on the other hand, proposes 58.1 million dollars to help address the shortfall. This 58.1 million dollars would be enough to help school districts complete this fiscal year. Another component of the Senate&rsquo;s budget that is not in the House Budget is the removal of the cap on state funding of school support positions. This cap, put in place during the great recession, limits the amount of funding available for positions such as custodians, assistant Superintendents, school nurses, and other support positions. By removing it, our school districts will be able to attract and retain critical staff who make our schools run better and improve our students' daily lives. The proposed Senate Budget includes over one billion dollars in direct aid to school divisions, over seven hundred million more than the amount set aside by the House of Delegates. This critical investment in our children&rsquo;s education is a strong reminder of our commitment to ensuring a better future for all Virginians. In addition to our K-12 schools, the Senate Budget includes an additional twenty million dollar increase in funding for Pre-K, ensuring access to affordable early education &ndash; a key indicator of long term educational success. Finally, the Senate budget diverts all proposed additional funding from Governor Youngkin&rsquo;s &ldquo;lab school&rdquo; proposals, which have come to be seen by many as a backdoor to publicly funded charter schools. I am a firm believer that public funds should be spent on public education.&nbsp;<br /><br />Additionally, the proposed Senate Budget includes an increase in funding for mental and behavioral health services. Our budget sets aside an additional eight million dollars on top of what was introduced by the Governor to address the mental health crisis that is plaguing Virginia. Providing greater access to mental healthcare, particularly for our youth, will help increase the quality of life for Virginians. Additionally, providing more funding for mental health professionals will ultimately take pressure off of law enforcement as police officers will not be in the position to be responding to mental health calls.<br /><br />There are major differences between the two budgets both in terms of what is in the budget and on how much money should be dedicated to particular projects. In the coming weeks, members of the House and Senate money committees will work to alleviate the discrepancies and create a conference budget that can pass in the coming weeks.<br></div>

				<div class="paragraph">While the 2023 Legislative Session is only halfway over, the last few days leading up to &ldquo;crossover&rdquo; were a whirlwind. Each body of the General Assembly has now completed action on its own legislation and has transferred what passed to the other. The last few days prior to crossover were intense and drawn out. Committee meetings, budget meetings, and floor sessions felt like marathons. Similar to a marathon, which takes months of preparation, many of the decisions that were facing the General Assembly this session took months of preparation and deliberation leading up to final votes being cast.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade this past June by the U.S. Supreme Court, it became evident that the issue of reproductive freedom would be a dominant theme of session. Without the Supreme Court precedent, both anti-choice and pro-choice advocates are seeking legislative action, rallying at the Capitol and gathering in the halls of legislative offices. On the anti-choice side, legislation has been introduced to ban abortion totally, implement unnecessary, onerous barriers to accessing abortion, and ban abortion after fifteen weeks. The final bill, which has staunch support from Governor Glenn Youngkin, was introduced by Delegate Kathy Byron (R-Bedford). This bill was not docketed in the House and the Senate version introduced by Senator Steve Newman (R-Bedford) was defeated in committee. While on the pro-choice side, Senator Jennifer McClellan (D-Richmond) and Delegate Charniele Herring (D-Alexandria) introduced a constitutional amendment to enshrine the right to reproductive healthcare into our state constitution. I was proud to vote for the Constitutional amendment in the Senate.&nbsp;<br /><br />Governor Youngkin attended a &ldquo;March for Life '' on Capitol Square last Wednesday, rallying with the religious school groups and activists to show his support for their cause and Delegate Byron&rsquo;s bill, which he has listed as one of his top legislative priorities. Two days later the bill&rsquo;s committee of origin &ndash; the House Judiciary Committee &ndash; held their final meeting without giving the bill a hearing. As such, it is dead for this session without a single vote being cast.&nbsp;<br /><br />Another issue that has been in the headlines is the role of the State Corporation Commission in regulating utilities like Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power. There have been two proposed legislative changes on the Senate side to address this issue. SB1265 introduced by Senator Dick Saslaw (D-Fairfax) would establish a bi-annual review of rates that a utility would be able to charge for electricity, and change the way the State Corporation Commission, which regulates energy utilities, calculates allowed return on investment for the company. The calculation would change the minimum return on equity based on a peer group of other electric utilities in the south. The average return of this peer group is 10.07%, over 1% higher than what Dominion currently receives, which could potentially increase your monthly electric bill. Despite my vote against the legislation, it did pass. This bill will continue to be amended as it proceeds through the House of Delegates. A different proposal by Senator Jennifer McClellan (D-Richmond) and Senator Creigh Deeds (D-Charlottesville) would install more parameters to protect consumers from rate hikes including restoring the State Corporation Commission&rsquo;s authority to lower electric utility rates when the agency determines that customers will be overcharged. I voted for this bill in committee and was pleased to see it pass the Senate.<br /><br />As we begin the second half of the session, all but one of the bills that I introduced have reported positively and await hearings in the House. My SB1133 which would create a regulated cannabis retail market for adults. Another of my bills that I am pleased to see in good posture is my legislation to allow condominium owners to apply as a group to a locality&rsquo;s Stormwater Management Grant Program for joint projects. Previous state law did not specify that condominium owners could apply for these items jointly. This bill would allow more Virginians access to funds to help protect their property from flooding. My SB1085 which would establish a work group to research and propose solutions to reduce excessive vehicle noise passed. SB1087 which stipulates that companies like ancestry.com and 23andme cannot sell your genetic information without your consent, passed unanimously. Additionally, I have two bills designed to improve our elections, one to allow additional protections for election workers and another to provide more funds for election administration have passed the Senate as well. You can read more about my full legislative agenda here.<br /><br />After crossover, we are officially in the second half of the session and the process in a way has started all over again. All of my bills that passed in the Senate will be put to the test in the House of Delegates, and my fellow Senators and I will begin the process of vetting all the bills that passed the House. While it may feel a bit like the movie Groundhog Day having to foster bills through a second time, the process is important to promote thoughtful legislation.<br /><br />I look forward to the challenge, and it is my continued honor to serve the 30th District.</div>

				<div class="paragraph">As the General Assembly nears the midway point of the Legislative Session, committee dockets balloon with oft-amended bills on some of the more substantial and complicated issues of the session. Members and interest groups, searching for consensus, known as &ldquo;peace in the valley&rdquo; in General Assembly parlance, are coming to final agreements, or pushing forward against opposition in committee. As the Chairman of the Senate General Laws and Technology Committee, I have the opportunity to set committee dockets and work with stakeholders on varied issues before they come before the committee as a whole. This week has been especially interesting as we tackle the issues of Virginia&rsquo;s gaming industry, affordable housing access, workforce development, and even the naming of an official Virginia State pony (the proposed icon is the Chincoteague pony).&nbsp;<br /><br />Since Virginia made its first foray into expanded options for gaming several years ago, we have seen a drastic increase in the size and diversity of our gaming industry. While these forms of gaming have already generated a great deal of economic development and revenue for the state, there have been concerning trends in increased gambling addiction, and unclear effects on lower income and young Virginians. While there are some benefits to the gaming industry, I do not believe that we should view it as a panacea. I was glad to see two proposals which would have dramatically expanded the industry &ndash; one to place a casino in northern Virginia, and one to permanently authorize and allow the expanded placement of slot machines in restaurants and convenience stores &ndash; struck from the committee docket.&nbsp;<br /><br />Over the course of the session the committee has taken up proposals to alter the state&rsquo;s regulations on our building code inspectors, and removing licensing requirements for landscape architects, geologists, interior designers, and auctioneers, among others &ndash; part of a push by the Governor to arbitrarily reduce regulations by 25% over his term. We have tackled a number of proposals to further reduce the likelihood of Virginians being evicted or denied housing, a long-time priority of mine. The committee has also reviewed a proposal to create television production grant funds to incentivize more production of streaming and cable shows like Dopesick. There has also been a significant focus on the treatment of our veterans, and creating pathways for novel treatments of PTSD such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy. During the first week of session, we passed legislation to require the Department of Emergency Management to stand up a comprehensive emergency heat response plan in order to more adequately protect Virginians most vulnerable residents &ndash; the infirmed, elderly, and homeless, from major heat events, and more recently, passed legislation expanding our local government advisory boards to meet virtually, improving citizen participation and diversity in membership by lowering the barriers to attend and be a member of these committees.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the coming week we will complete our work on these diverse topics, as well as delving into state procurement, regulations for construction contracts, and even proposals from Governor Youngkin to ban the use of TikTok on state devices &ndash; truly putting the &ldquo;general&rdquo; in General Laws. I look forward to finishing the work of the Senate, and welcoming a new and equally diverse set of bills to my committee from my House colleagues in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="paragraph">Despite the season, it has been a balmy fifty degrees most days here in Richmond. The usually sagging coat racks have remained empty, Capitol Square has been bustling with government employees and medical professionals from the nearby VCU Hospital enjoying their lunch breaks, and the usually high-in-demand cold-weather shuttle to parking decks has been shirked by legislators in favor of pleasant strolls to their rental units. While this unseasonable warm snap is not, in and of itself, proof of a changing climate, it is an indicator of a well accepted scientific fact: our earth is warming, altering, due to human activity.&nbsp;<br /><br />Unfortunately, neither the gentle reminder brought on by the warmer days or the rather stark realities of our rapidly declining environment have convinced our current gubernatorial administration or my Republican colleagues that we must take meaningful action to transition to a renewable energy future. In fact, GOP legislators have introduced a wide swath of bills to roll back our progress on clean energy and climate action laws.&nbsp;<br /><br />The three central tenets of Virginia&rsquo;s clean energy transition &mdash; Virginia&rsquo;s Clean Car standards, our participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), and the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) &ndash; face legislative challenges in both chambers and, in RGGI&rsquo;s case, through the regulatory process. If repealed, the brighter future created by the past administrations will grow dim, and our existing investment and progress would be wasted.&nbsp;<br /><br />RGGI is a regional cap and trade program which provides hundreds of millions of dollars in flood mitigation and energy efficiency investments for low income Virginians. The state&rsquo;s participation in the program currently faces multiple obstacles. Despite GOP talking points, the facts are clear: RGGI is an effective program to help individual states and our nation transition away from carbon polluting energy.&nbsp;<br /><br />RGGI states had far surpassed Virginia with emissions reductions before we entered the compact in 2021. From 2005 to 2020, RGGI states saw their emissions drop by twice as much as Virginia&mdash;59-percent in RGGI states compared to 30-percent in Virginia. In RGGI&rsquo;s first year alone in Virginia (2021), our statewide pollution decreased by 13 percent.<br /><br />My 21 Democratic senate colleagues and I are prepared to defeat any legislation attempting to withdraw us from the compact. We are equally prepared to combat current attempts by Governor Glenn Youngkin to withdraw Virginia from RGGI through the administrative rule making process. Former Attorney General Mark Herring ruled this kind of act would be unlawful. Without statutory authority, it is likely the Governor&rsquo;s ploy to remove us from RGGI will soon be tied up in litigation, further delaying clean energy goals and wasting your tax dollars.&nbsp;<br /><br />House and Senate Republicans have also attempted to repeal our adoption of the 15-state Clean Car standards, which set stricter vehicle emissions limits than the federal government imposes and gradually increase the availability of EVs on car lots across the Commonwealth, in line with automakers&rsquo; own goals of going all-electric. Federal law prohibits Virginia from enacting our own regulations on tailpipe emissions. Under the federal Clean Air Act, we are required to adopt emissions standards set by either the EPA or the Clean Cars standard. The GOP proposals would kneecap our ability to reduce personal vehicle emissions, which make up 70% of all carbon pollution in our largest pollution source: transportation. I am glad to report that the Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee defeated these proposals.&nbsp;<br /><br />It is critical to play effective defense on our environmental goals, at least long enough to provide time for Virginia&rsquo;s utilities to make long term investment in renewables. This strategy is already succeeding &ndash; earlier this month Dominion Energy, Virginia&rsquo;s largest regulated utility, announced a slate of projects in their Climate Report 2022 which will make solar energy our main power generator by 2040, phasing out coal by 2030, and steadily reducing the use of fracked gas over a 20-year period. These projects go a long way towards combating global warming and increasing air and water quality across our state.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ll continue fighting to defend that progress in Richmond and will fight to make even more in the years ahead.<br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span><font color="#000000">The second week of the 2023 legislative session began with what many groups refer to as &ldquo;lobby day&rdquo; &ndash; Martin Luther King Jr Day, when school and work closures allow a wide range of constituencies to visit the Capitol in Richmond. The halls of the Pocahontas&nbsp;building teemed with advocates for education, tenants'&nbsp;rights groups, high school students on field trips, and parents with young children, many witnessing the process of representative government for the first time. The diverse viewpoints and perspectives shared throughout the halls of government all day on Monday were a reminder to my colleagues and me of the solemn duty of both representing our constituencies, and the complex interests of our entire Commonwealth here in Richmond.&nbsp;<br /><br /></font></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Much agreement is found during these meetings, but sometimes, civil discourse on contentious topics does not come to a mutual resolution. One such issue, which we hear a great deal about is gun violence. Each year, advocates from the Virginia Citizens Defense League organize in Richmond on MLK Day to discuss their strongly held beliefs of an unlimited right to bear arms. While we disagree, often strongly, I always appreciate meeting with constituents with differing opinions and having robust debate over these issues.<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I was glad to stand with a group of my colleagues including Senators Creigh Deeds (D-Bath), Jennifer Boysko (D-Fairfax), Chap Petersen (D-Fairfax), and Dave Marsden (D-Fairfax) to announce the roll out of the Senate Democratic Caucus&rsquo;s gun violence prevention priorities, which includes two bills I introduced. Our legislative agenda includes bills to ban the sale of assault-style weapons, create penalties for the negligent storage of firearms in homes with minors present; establish civil fines for leaving an unsecured firearm in a vehicle; establish standards of responsible conduct for the firearm industry in Virginia, and enacting clear criteria and parameters for judges to review when filing Extreme Risk Protective Orders (also known as red-flag laws).&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">My two pieces of legislation ban the sale of &ldquo;ghost guns&rdquo; and the open, public carry of assault-style semi-automatic weapons. Ghost guns are untraceable firearms which can be bought online, assembled from kits with ease, and function precisely like any other firearm. These weapons pose a serious and deliberate problem. Law enforcement report seeing a rise in the use of ghost guns in criminal acts and accidental shootings. The process of converting ghost gun parts &mdash; which can be purchased without a background check, license or record of sale, into a functioning firearm &mdash; involves just a few steps and can be completed without any special skill.&nbsp; They are particularly enticing to people who cannot pass a background check &mdash; domestic abusers, minors, organized crime, and those with a violent felony record. My legislation seeks to fix a loophole: manufacturers are required to put a serial number on finished firearms but not on individual parts. This bill requires manufacturers, dealers, and distributors to add a serial number, which legitimizes a weapon and makes it traceable if used in a crime.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">My second bill bans the public carry of assault style weapons, whose definition closely reflects the highly successful 1994 assault weapon ban. Weapons of war have no place in civil society and certainly not on our streets where they frighten our families. Regular issue law enforcement service weapons aren&rsquo;t a match for these military weapons and their standard issue vests can&rsquo;t stop a high velocity bullet. This legislation is critical both to preserving safety in public spaces, but also to protect our public servants.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I look forward to a spirited debate on these important bills in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">It is my continued honor to serve the 30th District.&nbsp;</span></span><br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The General Assembly gaveled into the 2023 legislative session on Wednesday, January 11th at noon. We began the session just one day after three special elections occurred across Virginia. In the House, the partisan makeup remains unchanged at 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats, with Delegate-elect Holly Seibold (D-Fairfax) replacing former Delegate Mark Keam, who resigned from his seat to join the Biden Administration, and Delegate-elect Ellen Hamilton Campbell (R-Rockbridge) succeeding her late husband, former Delegate Ronnie Campbell, who sadly passed away from cancer in December.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">In a hotly contested race to replace former senator, now Congresswoman Jen Kiggans in Virginia Beach, Democrat Aaron Rouse defeated Republican candidate Kevin Adams. I look forward to welcoming Senator-Elect Rouse to Richmond this week, where his swearing in will expand our Democratic majority to 22-18.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">With this split legislature and a Republican executive branch, I expect the session will play out much like the 2022 session &ndash; in which compromise on nonpartisan issues created some incremental progress, and tie-breaking votes moved forward portions of the Governor&rsquo;s agenda, creating unnecessary and deleterious backslides. My legislative agenda contains a number of pragmatic, nonpartisan proposals to benefit the 30th District, including battling inland flooding, regulating intentionally loud modified car mufflers, protecting the privacy of our genetic data information, and protecting election officials from harassment and intimidation. But I will also continue to push on crucial, progressive priorities including the regulation marijuana sales, gun violence prevention, and LGBT marriage equality. For these proposals to become law this year, it will require political courage from members of the legislature to vote their conscience.<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Nevertheless, I am hopeful that over the next 46 days, my colleagues and I will make significant progress for Virginians. We expect to hear up to </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">2,000 pieces of legislation</span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)"> and will amend the second year of our biennial budget. The Governor laid out his priorities in early December and provided the Money Committees with a starting point. I feel strongly that the Governor&rsquo;s proposals fall short in many areas, continuing to prioritize tax gimmicks over funding of core services like public education. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make meaningful investments in the needs of the Commonwealth as a whole, rather than reducing taxes for major corporations and the wealthiest Virginians.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I also expect that my Democratic Senate colleagues and I will have our work cut out for us defending the progress Virginia has made over the last several years. Already we have seen bills filed to restrict reproductive rights, siphon public dollars to private schools, and discriminate against transgender students. I look forward to working with my colleagues, and using my new chairmanship over the Senate General Laws and Technology Committee to both move forward the operation and efficiency of Virginia government, and to defeat any antiquated, backwards proposals and defend our shared priorities and rights.&nbsp;</span></span><br /></div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">When the General Assembly entered the legislative session, the state was experiencing steady financial growth &ndash; years of strong fiscal management combined with an infusion of federal aid had built a budget surplus with which we could make significant investments in the people of Virginia. The new economic pressures of the last six months, coupled with the partisan makeup of the House and Executive Branch, extended our budget negotiations far beyond the legislative session. Thoughtful negotiations produced a compromised budget proposal which we voted to send to the Governor for his approval on June 1st.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The final budget, negotiated by a small group of budget conferees, reflects some priorities of both Republicans and Democrats. While the final deal falls short of some of the proposals which then-Governor Ralph Northam made in December, it still retains major investments in education, the environment, and public infrastructure. I was also glad to see several of my budget priorities included in the final spending plan. At the same time, the budget provides some important, though measured reforms to tax policy which will hopefully alleviate the strain caused by the record price hikes suffered across the world which we have witnessed this year.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">These prudent decisions include increasing the standard deduction to $8,000 for single filers and $16,000 for couples, the removal of the state portion of the grocery tax, direct $250 rebates to taxpayers, and a refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for low income Virginians.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">After a challenging two years of pandemic learning, the legislature made the most significant investment in K-12 and higher education in recent memory. This included a 10% pay raise over two years for K-12 teachers plus one time $1,000 bonus and $10 million in American Rescue Plan funds for recruitment incentives for hard-to-fill education positions. We allotted $400 million in school construction and modernization funding paired with an additional $450 million from the literary fund for loans for targeted school construction projects. To improve in-person learning we also chose to increase the number of support positions per 1000 students from 17.5 to 21 over the biennium and funded 1 reading assistant per every 550 students in kindergarten through third grade.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The budget makes strong investments in public safety and mental healthcare including $195.7 million for targeted compensation initiatives for sworn officers of the Department of State Police, correctional officers and probation and parole officers, and Deputy Sheriffs and Regional Jail Officers. We also allocated $13 million for community violence-focused grant programs to reduce gun and group violence through intervention services.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">Though I believe we could have taken bolder steps to combat the cost of housing, I am glad that the budget also includes a total of $150 million for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and includes $240 million in state tax credits to support the building and preservation of affordable housing.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">It is also important to note that despite the Governor Youngkin&rsquo;s calls to pull Virginia out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas initiative (RGGI), the compromise budget retains our place in RGGI and the resulting hundreds of millions in community flood prevention dollars and energy efficiency programs which we have won through the sale of carbon credits.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">I was glad to see several requests I made included in the final budget including complete funding for the construction of the John Warner Maritime Center in Alexandria, funding to preserve and digitize records of patients at Central State Hospital, and $8 million to provide air conditioning at several currently unairconditioned correctional facilities.&nbsp;<br /></span></span><br /><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The final budget is the product of diligent work and compromise by the General Assembly hashed out over months of negotiation. It is my hope the Governor will sign it quickly. Doing so will allow these important and, in some cases, historically large investments in the Commonwealth to move forward at a crucial time of pandemic recovery and economic growth.</span></span><br />&#8203;</div>

				<div class="paragraph"><span>On Monday evening Politico released a draft copy of a Majority Opinion in&nbsp;<em>Dobbs v. Jackson</em>, a Supreme Court case challenging the Constitutional right to abortion care &mdash; a right which has been considered settled precedent since the landmark&nbsp;<em>Roe</em>&nbsp;decision in 1973. The leak signals an unsurprising but nonetheless traumatizing reality: there appears to be a SCOTUS majority ready to strip women of their bodily autonomy.&nbsp;</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; The opinion lays out a road map to the conservative legal movement which indicates other rights born from the right to privacy are next on the list: gay marriage, interracial marriage, and the right to birth control to name a few. These assaults will affect us all, but it is critical to acknowledge that, as so often occurs in the policy making of the Right, those first to suffer, and who will suffer the most harm, are women of color and indigenous women. Key to protecting those most vulnerable is continuing to fight, as they are forced to, despite the sometimes exhausting nature of these battles. We must be active allies.&nbsp;</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me be clear &mdash; I will continue to fight to ensure women in Virginia will retain the right to bodily autonomy . You have a right to abortion care today, and you will tomorrow if you are within the Commonwealth. My Democratic colleagues and I will continue to fight to preserve and expand defenses of women&rsquo;s reproductive healthcare and the rights of marginalized communities. In many states that right has never been more at risk.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Leaking a Supreme Court opinion is an unprecedented step, and it is not yet clear what this signals about the reported debate among the court&rsquo;s more moderate members on this case. But the ramifications are clear - &nbsp;no matter the final vote in this case &mdash; states with anti-abortion laws on the books will feel unencumbered to further restrict abortion access, those seeking and providing abortion care will face expanded danger from far-right groups, and women&rsquo;s safety and ability to make their own medical choices will be destabilized.&nbsp;</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Political action must be taken to right this wrong and steady our democracy before every right to autonomy crumbles before the Court. But just as importantly, we must take mutual action to support those who will suffer the greatest harm from this opinion. I am asking you to consider joining me in contributing what you are able to the&nbsp;<a href="https://keepourclinics.org/donate/?emci=9935679b-05cb-ec11-997e-281878b83d8a&amp;emdi=ea000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;ceid={{ContactsEmailID}}" target="_blank">Virginia Abortion Care Network</a>. &nbsp;</span><br /><span></span><br /><br /><span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; I stand with you, and am here to listen to your ideas, concerns, and stories.&nbsp;</span><br /><span></span><br /><br /><span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is my continued honor to represent the 30th District.</span><br /><span></span>Adam P.
